The inaugural Workshop on Cross-species Emotion Research (CSE) at ISRE 2024 invites researchers from a variety of fields including - but not limited to - emotion science, evolutionary biology, social cognition, affective computing, psychology, human-robot interaction (HRI), and philosophy to discuss **interdisciplinary perspectives on emotion research from a cross-species perspective or highlight how computational methods can transform research in affective science**.

Understanding emotions - where they come from, and how are they expressed and recognized - is an ongoing challenge in the fields of psychology, biology, and, more recently, computer science. However, emotion research has been hampered by the lack of integration between these fields and the almost exclusive focus in psychology on human emotions. This gap, while recognized within specialized fields, has not been effectively addressed within the broader landscape of emotion research, leading to a fragmented understanding of this fundamental aspect of the human and non-human animal mind. By bringing together a wide variety of researchers (including, but not limited to, evolutionary biologists, computer scientists, psychologists, anthropologists, and philosophers) **this pre-conference will foster interdisciplinary collaboration, knowledge exchange, and the identification of key research gaps under the theme “Emotions Across Species: Form and Function”**.

By touching upon the various layers of emotional research from a human, animal, and animat perspective, the CSE workshop aims to further our understanding of the fundament of emotion and affect, and at the same time to enhance technologies aimed at understanding, modifying, or interacting with human or animal affective processes.

### Abstract Submissions and Registration

Abstract submissions for **Poster and “Flash Talk” presentations are accepted**. We invite authors to submit contributions in the shape of an extended abstract. The extended abstract should be 1000 words (references excluded) in PDF format and should outline the goals of the research, the methods used, and a summary of the results. The extended abstract should also contain one question/challenge that should be addressed during the workshop. Submissions are welcome from any career status. Acceptance of the contribution is at the discretion of the program committee based on a review by the committee. Extended abstracts will be published online, but not through an official publisher, meaning that you keep the copyright and you are still able to submit elsewhere.

Motivation Letter Submission:

We welcome individuals who wish to attend the pre-conference without presenting a poster or giving a flash talk. In such cases,  attendees are asked to submit a motivation letter (max 1000 words) in PDF format. This letter should articulate their genuine interest in the workshop's theme and clearly explain the relevance of their participation to their academic or professional goals. The motivation should also contain one question/challenge that should be addressed during the workshop. Submissions are welcome from any career status. Motivation letters will be reviewed, and participants will be selected based on the strength of their motivation and alignment with the workshop's objectives.
