Emotions are inherently social, in that they are heavily influenced by interactions with others. Most of the time, they arise, evolve, and are managed in the company of and by others, whose emotions, in turn, become impacted by us as well. Fortunately, there is a growing awareness of how intertwined emotions and interpersonal relationships are, and research on this topic is rapidly increasing. In light of this evolution, **this pre-conference focusses on emotions in the context of interpersonal relationships, with a particular emphasis on its dynamic nature**. It will feature a series of talks presenting cutting-edge research. **Keynotes** and **flash talks** will span across multiple domains, including a wide spectrum of emotions and interpersonal relationships, such as parent-child interactions, romantic relationships and leader-member exchanges. Keynote speakers (see below) are invited experts from different fields, ranging from broader social psychology to clinical and family science. Additionally, there will be a **debate** about the current state and future of the field, and we are honored to announce that prof. dr. Agneta Fischer will conclude this exciting day as a **discussant**. 

Through this program, we aim to exchange knowledge on the intricate ways in which emotions shape and are shaped by interpersonal relationships, and to identify key research gaps in this rapidly expanding field. Our goal is to bring together researchers from all stages and disciplines, fostering connection and interdisciplinary collaboration over this important topic.

We will be accepting abstract submissions for flash talk presentations (5-minute talks with 5 minutes for Q&A). Presentations should address the topic of emotions in the context of interpersonal relationships, preferably assessing research questions in a dynamic way. The abstract can be a maximum of 500 words and should outline the goals of the research, the methods used, and a summary of the results. Acceptance as a flash talk will be decided after review by the organizers, based on the fit with the main theme and with other talks.
