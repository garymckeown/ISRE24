The Affective Computing Pre-Conference features state-of-the-art research on computational techniques for recognizing, modelling and shaping human emotion, and emphasizes ways to strengthen interdisciplinary connections between the computational and human sciences of emotion. 

**Submitted contributions and invited speakers discuss the latest research on computational methods inspired by the affective sciences, as well as how such methods can transform research in affective science**. For submitted contributions, we will be accepting extended abstract submissions for Poster and Flash Talk presentations (instructions below). This year’s focus is **“Opportunities, challenges, and impacts of computational methods in emotion research”**.

This year, we are also organizing **a special session on research using Large Language Models and affective science**, across the range of basic and applied research questions, for example: how well do these models understand emotions; what can we learn from the nature/representation of emotions in these models; how can we use these models to generate artificial stimuli, or label data; how can we use these models in applied systems (e.g., for emotional well-being).

## Organisation

This pre-conference is sponsored by the **Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC)**. The pre-conference is part of the affective computing preconference series started in 2017 in Boston at SAS, and the 2019 and 2022 pre-conferences at ISRE. The Affective Computing preconference attempts to support the increasing interest in the interdisciplinary study of emotion in which computational modelling as well as computational analysis play an important role.
