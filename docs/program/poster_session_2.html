Although previous research shows that explicit evaluations of smiles are influenced by context and vice versa, the joint effects of smiles and contexts on subsequent behaviour are less clear. Consequently, across three experiments, we assessed behavioural responses to face-context compound stimuli using a phone-based approach-avoidance task. Participants were instructed to push (“avoid”) or pull (“approach”) their phone according to smiler gender (study 1), smile type (study 2), or context valence (study 3).\n \n In Study 1, while participants reacted to faces in positive contexts more quickly than faces in negative contexts across response types, smile type did not significantly affect reaction time. In Study 2, reward smiles were approached more quickly than dominance smiles, and vice versa for avoidance responses. We also found a significant context-response interaction. Smiles in positive contexts were approached more quickly than smiles in negative contexts, but this relationship was absent for avoidance responses. In Study 3, positive situations were approached more quickly than negative situations, and vice versa for avoidance responses. Interestingly, smile type did not significantly affect reaction times for either approach or avoidance responses.\n \n Together, these findings show that while contexts implicitly affect behavioural responses to smiles, smiles don’t implicitly affect behavioural responses to contexts. This suggests that whilst situational context is automatically processed when evaluating facial expressions, processing of expressions when evaluating contexts is likely a more deliberative and effortful process.","Caring for a child with epilepsy poses various economic and psychosocial challenges. These can lead to stress and burden but also positive experiences of epilepsy care. For this study, we computed path analyses to identify both direct and indirect predictors of positive aspects of caregiving by mothers with a child with epilepsy. Our path model included sociodemographic, illness and mental health factors. A total of 168 women were recruited while attending the Pediatric Neurology Clinic at Soroka Medical Center, Be’er Sheva, Israel. This sample included 130 Jewish-Israeli and 38 Arab-Bedouin mothers caring for a child with epilepsy who completed parallel questionnaire batteries in Hebrew or Arabic. In our path model, burden is directly predicted by emotional exhaustion, (Arab) ethnicity, and the absence of social support and life satisfaction. Positive aspects of caregiving are directly predicted, in turn, by self-efficacy and (low) caregiver burden. Positive aspects of caregiving are indirectly predicted by (Jewish) ethnicity (via higher social support, life satisfaction and self-efficacy), lower illness severity and emotional exhaustion (via higher self-efficacy), and higher psychological well-being (via lower emotional exhaustion). Bedouin mothers reported greater illness severity, symptoms of depression and caregiver burden. Differences between groups in epilepsy severity suggest that less severe cases in the Bedouin community do not come to clinical attention (e.g., concealed due to stigma). These findings underscore the importance of health promotion strategies and interventions for epilepsy caregivers, tailored to account for ethnic and cultural differences.","Introduction: Successful emotion regulation (ER) depends on the flexible matching of strategies to the current situational context. However, there is a lack of research on ER interventions aimed at providing context-dependent strategy recommendations for adolescents. Therefore, this ecological momentary intervention (EMI) explores the effect and feasibility of a mobile application providing context-dependent ER strategy recommendations. It was hypothesized that the context-based EMI would improve adolescents’ wellbeing and ER more than a non-context based EMI or an ESM control.\n Method: Adolescents were randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups. For 14 days, all groups reported their emotions several times per day. The context-based EMI and the EMI control received educational content on ER skills and strategies. After reporting negative emotions, the EMI group received context-dependent strategy recommendations, while the EMI control received random recommendations. About 30 minutes later, all groups indicated their current emotions and the strategies they applied since the last prompt. Additionally, participants filled out questionnaires measuring ER and mental health factors pre- and post-intervention. Analyses were performed using multilevel models.\n Results: Data collection and analysis will be finalized by Spring 2024. \n Conclusion: This EMI is among the first to test the effectiveness of context-dependent just-in-time recommendations for ER strategy use in adolescents. The study’s results and limitations will provide future directions for tailored ER interventions.","In recent years the concept of empathy, as far as the educational sciences are concerned, has been discussed (e.g. Liekam, 2004; Scheu, 2012;) but to this day this discussion has not been carried out within the field of foreign language didactics. Although empathy is directly related to human relationships, it is not one of the main objectives of language teaching within the “Common European Framework of Reference for Languages” (CEFR). The aim of the study presented in the poster is to examine the benefit of empathy in the field of foreign language didactics and suggest a learning scenario to aid foreign language teachers in fostering empathy in the classroom.\n \n The “Reference Framework of Competences for Democratic Culture” (RFCDC) identifies empathy as a skill in the broader set of competences for democratic culture. Since the cultivation of competences is the main didactical goal of foreign language learning, as defined in the CEFR, the need to incorporate empathy as a skill to foreign language learning and to the related competences is apparent. Empathy is indeed not an emotion, but an affective-social ability which can be derived from emotions and can regulate emotions. And although it is long proven that affective factors play a role in foreign language learning (e.g. Börner & Vogel, 2004; Burwitz-Melzer et al., 2020), empathy is still not researched in this respect. The study concludes that empathy can act as a supporting force that enables intercultural and multicultural interaction, that is, as a booster for intercultural competence.","The research goal was the operationalization and experimental verification of gain and loss zones in risky choice framing, using explanatory concepts from prospect theory (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) and the risk-as-feelings model (Loewenstein, et al., 2001).\n Zones were represented via combining subjective value and probability of risky choice outcomes, the choice between risky and safe options (prospect theory), as well as anticipative and anticipatory emotions – how a person feels when choosing and how they expect to feel after the choice outcome (risk-as-feelings). Zones were induced via counterbalanced risky choice framing tasks.\n Participants in the loss zone were expected to take risks more often, devalue the safe outcome, and add value to positive and negative risk outcomes. Subjective probability assessments for positive risky choice outcomes were expected to rise; self-assessments of emotional states during decision making would be more negative in the loss zone, with an improved anticipated emotional state. Opposite tendencies for each measurement were assumed in the gain zone, except for the anticipated emotional state, as no expectations could be formed from the theoretical basis.\n Research assumptions were largely confirmed: Tasks combining all four concepts elicited a basic framing effect. Direct measurement of subjective value, as well as anticipative and anticipatory emotions, proved successful and in line with expectations. Measuring subjective probability seems to require a finer scale. Results support the operationalization of gain and loss zones through combining concepts from prospect theory and the risk-as-feelings model, offering a basis for further experimental research into these mostly theoretical constructs.","This study investigates the change of emotion words in Classical Arabic as a result of contact with English. 213 English words were selected for this purpose the equivalents of which were checked up in two bilingual English-Arabic dictionaries from two different periods. As is the case in other domains of contact, the processes found to operate in the semantic change of emotions were calquing, loan translation, loan rendition and extension, in addition to what is termed here “explanations”. Explanations are phrases intended to introduce the meaning of an item to users of bilingual dictionaries. What was noted is that some of these phrases ended up being lexicalizations of unfamiliar emotion categories. Loan words, however, were found to be very rare. It was argued that these kinds of change stand behind the development of a Modern Standard Arabic.","Facial icons are depictions of faces in diverse artistic and ethnographic artifacts across regions and eras. Despite their diverse origins, these artifacts share common features, notably facial features serving as foundational elements for facial expressions, which are effective means of communicating emotions. \n Previous research indicates a tendency to perceive specific facial-icon styles as (human) face categories in terms of neural responses. Empirical studies demonstrate facial icons' ability to induce facial mimicry and indicate potential emotional contagion, suggesting the influential role of simulated emotion in shaping the artistic relationship with facial icons. However, it remains unclear whether this emotion simulation occurs distinctly for different basic emotions and affects, and which morphometric features contribute to emotional contagion. To address these gaps, a study involving 45 participants conducted dual assessments. In the first, participants rated the expressed emotions in 11 cross-cultural facial icons, covering six basic emotions (happiness, sadness, surprise, disgust, fear, anger) and three affects (valence, arousal, dominance), along with seven morphometric features (human-likeness, ornamental-features, craft-quality, beauty, eye-contact, eye-expression, mouth-expression). In the second, participants assessed their own basic emotions and affects when exposed to these facial icons. \n Results revealed a significant impact of expressed emotions in facial icons on most participants' basic emotions and affects, indicating an emotional contagion. Specific morphometric features emerged as influential factors in shaping self-reported emotions. Notably, self-reported sadness showed diminished scores in response to facial icons characterized by heightened aesthetics (beauty and ornamental-features), suggesting a substantial impact on crucial emotional states such as well-being.","The present study aimed to explore the role of partners’ negative engaging and disengaging emotions in dealing with the frustration of autonomy and relatedness needs during conflict. In an observational study, partners from 141 heterosexual couples participated in a conflict interaction task followed by a video-mediated recall procedure during which they reported their level of relational need frustration and their emotions experienced at different moments during the interaction. Results showed that in partners, more autonomy frustration, experienced at the beginning of the conflict, was accompanied by more concurrent negative disengaging emotions (anger, irritation), whereas more relatedness frustration was accompanied by more negative engaging emotions (hurt, sadness, disappointment). Additionally, the concurrent association between partners’ relatedness frustration and their experience of negative engaging emotions was negatively moderated by their own relatedness relationship beliefs (as assessed by background questionnaires), indicating that for individuals who considered relatedness to be less important, relatedness frustration and negative engaging emotions were more strongly linked than for people with high relatedness beliefs. Finally, negative engaging emotions – assessed at the beginning of the conflict – were associated with more relatedness frustration at a subsequent time point in the interaction in men, but not in women. This study contributes to our understanding of how partners’ negative emotions and the frustration of important relational needs are intertwined.","The phenomenon of influencers on social media platforms such as Instagram is still gaining traction, and academia and practitioners aim to understand why and how influencers can impact their audiences to follow them and to change their behavior. Emotions that content creators generate among their followers are one key element for the strength of their influence. Therefore, this study will focus on the emotional level of the follower-influencer relationship. First, we analyze how emotions reflect into the feeling of a parasocial relationship, i.e. when followers feel as if the influencer would be their close friend although they might have never met in person or have never spoken to each other. Second, we investigate how emotions lead to the perception of trustworthiness, i.e. the feeling of the follower that an influencer is honest, transparent and truthful. Finally, we will investigate how emotions towards hedonic and utilitarian content of an influencer can be used to shape consumer behavior. So far studies on influencers have mostly focused on follower counts, likes or comments to measure the effectiveness of influencers. Therefore, our research with its focus on emotions delivers new insights on the influencer-follower relationship. We analyze data from experiments and a survey to derive recommendations for theory and practitioners.","Despite the growing relevance of large language models like ChatGPT, research on how cross-cultural influences affect their response styles is limited. Understanding these impacts is crucial for developing systems that can meaningfully adapt to cultural differences.\n In their research, Chen et al. (1995) found that North American students have a more extreme response style than east asian students. Moreover, Schaaff et al. (2023) showed, that ChatGPT can respond to personality questionnaires in a similar way to healthy humans. Our study focuses on the response styles of Japanese and American adults, hypothesizing that cultural norms and values impact ChatGPT's responses.\n To do this, we prompted ChatGPT in English and Japanese and additionally asked it to respond as if it were either an American or a Japanese adult. To ensure that the response behavior is not just related to one single questionnaire, we used the following questionnaires: Empathy quotient, ten-item personality measure, and interpersonal reactivity index.\n A three-way ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of prompt language (p < .01) and a marginally significant main effect of imagined nationality (p = .067); namely, ChatGPT responded more extremely when prompted in English than in Japanese and when being asked to imagine being American than Japanese. There was no significant main effect of questionnaire or their interaction.\n Our findings have implications for improving the user experience and effectiveness of those systems in cross-cultural contexts as they show that ChatGPT adapts the way it responds to questions in correspondence to the persona and prompt language.","Disorganized/disoriented attachment resulting from repeated traumatic events in early childhood is considered the most critical risk factor for the future development of dissociative disorders. Dissociative disorders are also associated with severe emotional dysregulation. Therefore, it is clinically important to understand the characteristics of dissociation. Traditionally, dissociation has been viewed as categorical rather than dimensional, as suggested by early taxometric analyses (e.g., Waller et al., 1996). However, recent advances in taxometric methodology (Ruscio, 2007) and emerging studies have suggested that most psychological traits are dimensional (Haslam et al., 2020). Dissociation also needs to be re-examined. The present study used the taxometric analyses with Comparison Curve Fit Index (CCFI; Ruscio et al., 2017) to examine the latent structure of dissociation among Japanese adolescents (N=1170, 576 women, 593 men, and 1 of unknown gender). Dissociation severity was assessed using the Dissociation Experiences Scales-2 (Carlson & Putnam, 1993), and the scores of three distinct subscales––absorption, amnesia, and depersonalization––were calculated according to three-factor model by Stockdale et al. (2002). Our comprehensive taxometric analysis, incorporating various taxon base rates, consistently supports a dimensional structure of dissociation, as indicated by a mean CCFI below .422. These results demonstrate the appropriateness of considering dissociation as dimensional. Our findings suggest the need to re-examine previous results of taxometric analyses related to dissociation.","Pluralism often leads to heightened polarization, as various societal groups hold differing beliefs regarding what constitutes the right way of life. The disapproval-respect model of tolerance proposes that the disapproval at the intergroup level needs to be constrained by equality-based respect to enable tolerance. However, how do minorities react when they experience such (in)tolerance? And which emotional reactions encourage societal participation and a normative struggle for recognition? \n To address these questions, we conducted two 2x2 online experiments with samples of individuals with overweight (NStudy1 = 113, NStudy2= 227). We manipulated the disapproval and respect components of experienced (in)tolerance and examined the intergroup emotions, action tendencies, and willingness for normative and non-normative protest. We found, that the experience of (in)tolerance predicted the negative intergroup emotions anger and contempt, whereby more tolerance led to less anger and contempt. The anger reaction was significantly more pronounced than the contempt reaction. Mediation analyses indicated indirect effects of experienced (in)tolerance on action tendencies towards the outgroup and the willingness for normative protest via the intergroup emotion anger, with anger increasing the willingness to act. Contempt mediated the relationship between experienced (in)tolerance and confrontational action tendencies by negatively predicting the confrontational action tendencies. \n These findings reinforce the idea that anger plays a significant and influential role in the intergroup context, fostering political agency and empowering minorities to assert themselves in response to intolerance. Additionally, the findings suggest that intergroup contempt could be a less constructive emotion, as it inhibits approaching other groups.","Regret is a significant emotion in many legal systems, particularly in criminal law. In Czech criminal law, it is a mitigating circumstance, a condition for a decision to waive punishment or for a conditional release from imprisonment. As with other emotions, there are no objective criteria for its \"measurement\". The perception of the emotions of others is a subjective assessment that can only be more or less accurate with the experience of the other. The question arises: how does a judge determine whether it is genuine, not feigned remorse? Is it decided based on how the accused behave - or how they \"perform\" in the courtroom? But what if we are used to expressing our emotions and sincere feelings in other ways, perhaps in private, without facial expressions, hand gestures or tears? Emotions are sociocultural phenomena. How we express emotions is a matter of our socialization and the environment in which we grow up. Presented research opens a discussion on how Czech judges perceive and evaluate the experience of remorse of the offender. A content analysis of court judgments about deciding on waiver of punishment for the years 2019 to 2022 maps how judges justify their decisions regarding leniency in relation to the emotion of offender remorse. The research identifies how remorse is evaluated in our context and, with the help of previous empirical and theoretical research, also understands the possible limitations of these evaluations.","Introduction: Binge eating episodes have been conceptualized as a means to regulate emotions. However, studies examining the overall association between binge eating and changes in negative affect have produced inconsistent findings, questioning the regulatory function of binge eating. More fine-grained assumptions about changes in specific emotions may help to better understand the emotion regulation processes involved. Trade-off theory assumes that during binge eating episodes, aversive emotions that are difficult to tolerate (e.g., anger) are replaced (“traded”) by emotions that are still aversive, but easier to tolerate (e.g., guilt). An integration of studies testing these assumptions is still lacking.\n Method: The current meta-analysis focuses on changes in specific emotions (guilt, anger) around binge eating episodes. Effects (standardized mean change and Fisher’s r-to-Z transformed correlations) were integrated using random-effects models with robust variance estimation. \n Results: The synthesis included 14 studies (54 effect sizes, N = 553). Consistent with trade-off theory, there was a trend towards more pronounced increases in guilt levels compared to anger levels after binge eating episodes. However, both anger and guilt trajectories showed increases before binge eating, followed by subsequent decreases, with effects being small. Heterogeneity between studies was large across analyses. \n Conclusions: Contrary to trade-off-theory, the synthesis does not support the notion that anger is replaced by guilt after binge eating episodes. While the observed trend towards increased levels of guilt after binge eating merits further investigation, small effects suggest the need to consider emotions beyond guilt and anger to better understand binge eating and improve existing treatments.","Mixed emotions are the presence of two complex emotions toward a single target. We aim to study whether children can implicitly identify mixed emotions based on saccadic eye movements to displayed faces, and explicitly based on their verbal answers, and compare findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first eye-tracker study evaluating complex emotional contexts. \n Children (6-12 yo) were divided into two groups: a) typically developed (TD) (N=40), b) with a diagnosis (N=81) of Learning Disorder (LD) (dyslexia, dyscalculia, DLD, or ADHD). With the eye-tracker-software iMotions we presented an oral sentence (with the meaning of the emotion in the verb) simultaneously to four faces expressing different emotions. Then participants verbalized how they thought the person was feeling. We randomly presented 12 sentences including mixed emotions and 12 including non-mixed emotions. The proportion of eye fixations (implicit information) and their answers (explicit information) were analyzed.\n Implicit data analysis showed there were no differences between groups, and both can switch their look to the second target emotion in mixed condition. However, explicit data analysis showed they rarely verbalize two emotions. Plus, TD group verbalized correctly one of the two target emotions more times than LD group.\n Children can implicity recognize mixed emotions based on the semantic meaning of a sentence, given that they look significantly more at the two different emotions. Nonetheless, they seem to only become aware of one emotion. Furthermore, children with learning disorders present more difficulties when identifying explicit emotions than their TD peers.","Adolescence is associated with immaturities in emotional and behavioural problems (i.e., internalising and externalising behaviours; Ahmed et al., 2015) and self-control behaviours (Casey & Caudle, 2013). To understand this phenomenon, developmental change and the impact of the home environment (i.e., socioeconomic indicators, maternal emotional health) must be accounted for. Participants are 4251 nationally representative English 17-year-olds (55.4% female). Predictors include emotional internalising and externalising data (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire between ages 3-14) and family/socioeconomic indicators at age 3 (i.e., maternal education, Index of Multiple Deprivation, maternal depression). The outcomes come from two hypothetical monetary self-control tasks where Choice A was constant while Choice B consisted of a limited set of 10 options on a sliding scale with each following option either increasing the potential cost of the risk or the monetary reward received after delaying gratification. Uniquely, this data was analysed with ‘survival models’ which account for the statistical artefact that the exact point of participants’ limit for self-control could lie between two options. Results suggest that a greater reluctance to risk take is associated with less externalising or more internalising problems during adolescence, a comparative increase in internalising problems longitudinally and growing up in an economically deprived neighbourhood. Results suggest that problems with delaying gratification are associated with a higher average level of externalising problems across development, parents not finishing secondary education, being male and lower general intelligence. Thus, emotion and self-control development are linked and situated in important contexts which can explain adolescent behaviours even 14 years later.","Journalism instruction has long assumed a sense of curiosity: that journalists have questions about the world, people, and events, and then care enough to answer those questions. Curiosity is fundamental to how American journalism is taught, credited as a journalistic edge, the very impetus of story creation. But for academic analysis, classifying curiosity as a useful reporting tool does not engage with how journalists truly use it in practice. As I use it, curiosity is the emotion, experience, or desire to learn about something not immediately useful; it’s knowledge-seeking for some non-immediate need. Feature stories are explicitly set apart by their non-immediate-news nature. This gives features a specific posture toward exploring topics and events with a sense of curiosity.\n \n Drawing on a set of 18 semi-structured interviews with U.S.-based feature journalists and editors, this research explores how these professionals use curiosity to find story ideas by exploring news stories more in depth; by asking probing questions to themselves and to others; and by actively engaging with topics that are overlooked, underreported, or otherwise misunderstood.\n \n This research explores how a feature journalist’s phenomenological experience and professional performance of curiosity influences how she positions herself in the industry and engages her work. A feature journalist’s phenomenological experience and professional performance of curiosity are essential components of her self-concept. Curiosity is not just an inner experience but a relational one, shaped by the journalistic process in which it is expressed.","INTRODUCTION: Curiosity is an approach-orientation to novelty and the unknown. One type of curiosity is “morbid curiosity” (MC), which is a dispositional approach-orientation to abnormal stimuli that many people find aversive (e.g., horrific violence, disgusting body violations). However, it is unclear if MC reflects positive responses to aversive stimuli (e.g., pleasure, excitement) or lower negative reactivity (e.g., reduced horror) that dampens the aversiveness. Given that MC is positively associated with sensation-seeking (Harrison & Frederick, 2020), and that sensation-seeking is associated with lower reactivity to stressors (Roberti, 2004), it is possible that MC may reflect lower arousal to typically aversive stimuli that allows people high in MC to enjoy exploring abnormal stimuli as novel items of interest with less of the aversive emotional responses that would reduce the pleasure of such exploration. \n \n METHODS: To explore MC’s association with negative emotional reactivity to abnormal harm, two repeated-measures studies were conducted online (N = 120). Participants read four tabloid headlines that described a real person being harmed in an abnormal way. After each, they rated how much horror (“horrified”, “shocked”, α = .82; measured on a 5-point Likert scale) and physical arousal (5-point visual Self-Assessment Manikin; Lang, 1980) the headline elicited. Lastly, they answered the Violence and Body Violations subscales of the Morbid Curiosity Scale (12 items, α = .92; Scrivener, 2021). \n \n RESULTS: In General Estimating Equations analyses, horror was negatively predicted by MC, B_study1 = -.26 [95%CI: -.44, -.08], B_study2 = -.36 [-.59, -.13], and positively predicted by arousal, B_study1 = .77 [.67, .86], B_study2 = .62 [.47, .78]. But when MC and arousal were entered as simultaneous predictors of horror, the association between MC and horror was mediated by arousal, B_study1 = -.13 [-.31, .05], B_study2 = -.22 [-.44, .00]. \n \n DISCUSSION: This suggests a physiological component to MC, whereby MC was associated with lower arousal in response to unpleasant stimuli, which in turn dampened aversive feelings of horror. Thus, horrific events that low-MC people might experience as aversively abnormal, high-MC people may experience as interesting novelty that stimulates the approach motivation of curiosity.","To date, studies have not consistently provided evidence for age differences in emotion regulation. This study aims to explore whether there are differences between young and older individuals in their use of Reappraisal and Expressive Suppression when experiencing 10 emotions (anger, fear, sadness, disgust, guilt, shame, distress, upset, contempt and envy). \n One hundred and five participants (Males = 43.8%) were involved in this study. At the time of completing the questionnaire, 56 participants were aged between 18 and 39, and 49 were aged over 59. The questionnaire consisted in a brief description of Reappraisal and Expressive Suppression. Participants were asked to rate, for each strategy, how much they used it when experiencing each of the listed emotions. A series of T-Tests were run. Overall, the results show that the older group tended to use these emotion regulation strategies less than their younger counterparts. More specifically, while no significant difference between the groups emerged in relation to anger, disgust, distress, and contempt, older participants exhibited a reduced likelihood of employing the intended strategies when responding to emotions such as fear, sadness, guilt, shame, upset, and envy. The differences, which vary according to the strategies, will be discuss. In addition, also the differences between groups in terms of automatic versus intentional emotion regulation will be discussed.","In addition to formal wireless emergency alert (WEA) systems, mobile applications like \"Citizen\" (fka Vigilante) provide real-time hyperlocal crime and safety alerts. Although marketed as a “personal safety” app, Citizen has faced criticisms over its potential to increase fear, anxiety, and promote surveillance and vigilantism. While alert systems and safety apps are ubiquitous, there is a lack of research testing these systems and their (un)intended effects on users and communities. To address this gap, the proposed randomized controlled trial will assess the effects of receiving crime alerts from Citizen over the course of one week. Mobile experience sampling methods will be utilized to measure fear, negative affective responses, and risk perceptions. It is predicted that repeated exposure to local crime and safety alerts will significantly increase fear of crime, perceived risk of victimization, punitiveness, and risk reduction behaviors compared to baseline and the control (no app) group. Differential effects of gender are expected, such that individuals socialized as women will report greater fear, risk perceptions, and safety precautions compared to men, while men will report higher punitive policy attitudes. The results of this study have practical implications for the promotion of safety, public policy, and psychological and emotional wellbeing. Further, additional insights into the potential role of demographic and contextual factors can improve targeted interventions, particularly for vulnerable populations.\n \n Keywords: Communication/mass media; social networks; specific emotions","Introduction: Perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness are appraisals of unmet interpersonal needs associated with higher risk of suicidal ideation. While prior studies have examined the influence of negative interpersonal experiences on unmet interpersonal needs, little is known about the role of positive interpersonal processes. Interpersonal capitalization, the action of sharing a positive personal event with close others, is an interpersonal process that increases positive affect and connectedness between the sharer and the responder. This study examined whether daily capitalization was associated with fluctuations in perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and positive affect among adolescents at higher- and lower-risk of suicidal ideation.\n\nMethods: This study included adolescents (Mage=15.55; range=12-18; 74.55% female) with a major depressive disorder considered at higher-risk for suicidal ideation (Higher-Risk group; n=23), and adolescents without psychopathology considered at lower-risk for suicidal ideation (Lower-Risk group; n=32). Participants completed a ten-day daily-diary procedure with measures of daily interpersonal capitalization, positive affect, perceived burdensomeness, and loneliness as a proxy for thwarted belongingness. Within-person analyses examined the associations of daily capitalization with burdensomeness, loneliness, and positive affect across groups.\n\nResults: Only the higher-risk group reported lower perceived burdensomeness and loneliness on days where they engaged in more capitalization. While higher capitalization was associated with higher positive affect in both groups, the higher-risk group benefitted from larger increases in positive affect in response to capitalization.\n\nConclusion: Engaging in daily interpersonal capitalization may be useful to reduce daily thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness and increase positive affect among adolescents at higher risk for suicidal ideation.","The brain processes underlying the distinction between emotion-label words (e.g., happy, sad) and emotion-laden words (e.g., successful, failed) remain inconclusive in bilingualism research. The present study aims to directly compare the processing of these two types of emotion words in both the first language (L1) and second language (L2) by recording event-related potentials (ERP) from late Chinese-English bilinguals during a lexical decision task. The results revealed that in the early word processing stages, the N170 emotion effect emerged only for L1 negative emotion-laden words and L2 negative emotion-label words. In addition, larger early posterior negativity (EPN) was elicited by emotion-laden words than emotion-label words in both L1 and L2. In the later processing stages, the N400 emotion effect was evident for L1 emotion words, excluding positive emotion-laden words, while it was absent in L2. Notably, L1 emotion words elicited enhanced N400 and attenuated late positive complex (LPC) compared to those in L2. Taken together, these findings confirmed the engagement of emotion, and highlighted the modulation of emotion word type and valence in both early and late processing stages. Different neural mechanisms between L1 and L2 in processing written emotion words were elucidated.","Emotion plays a critical role in shaping prosocial behavior. Witnessing a person experiencing stress can encourage people to help. This interpersonal effect of emotion is, however, complex and not fully understood. People can give up helping because they realize that their effort might just be inefficient or because they don't feel motivated enough, and individual differences (such as in compassion and altruistic attitude) can play a critical role. This project aims to shade more on this topic using a multi-componential approach to emotion, stating that emotion elicits in a multimodal fashion, including the appraisal, motivational, physiological, feeling and action ones. We want to empirically show that compassion leads to motivation to help and hypothesize that this effect should be stronger in participants with higher altruistic and empathic traits.\n \n The participant (the empathizer) will be asked to perform a task, adapted from the computer-based slider task, to help another participant not be given electric shocks. In different trials, the empathizer experiences different levels of potential stress in their counterpart (induced by different strengths of the electric shock) and different levels of task difficulty. While performing the task, the skin conductance and heart rate are measured (the physiological component). Other emotional components are assessed from performance and by subjective rating. These multimodal responses then get analyzed at both conditional and group levels. Furthermore, the participant will perform the same task, but to obtain monetary rewards. Their responses and performances for the two goals can be compared between the higher- and lower-altruistic group. Data collection will be conducted soon.","The influences of our personality permeate across many aspects of our lives, including our health. Neuroticism–a broad personality dimensions characterized by a tendency to experience dysregulating and negative emotional experiences–has shown to be a particularly strong health-related personality dimension. For example, higher neuroticism has shown to predict greater likelihood to develop physical health conditions as well as greater mortality risk later in life, with the current evidence pointing mostly to behavioral and psychological habits (i.e., lower social, physical, and cognitive activities) as underlying factors for this predictive link. However, the dysregulating experiences constituting neurotic personality expressions could also affect individuals’ health via physiological manifestations of distress. Thus, this study examined whether neuroticism manifested in three psycho-cardiac distress indices: Heart-rate (HR), heart-rate variability (HRV), and Baevsky's stress index (SI). This study also explored the predictive strength of other broad personality dimensions according to the Big-Five personality model. College students (N = 71, Mage = 19.90, SD = 1.80, range: 18—28) first completed the Big-Five Personality Inventory. Then, their cardiac activity was monitored during a standard non-stimulating laboratory environment (i.e., seating privately in an armchair while breathing spontaneously). Multivariate regression analyses revealed that higher neuroticism uniquely predicted higher HR, lower HRV, and higher SI. Moreover, agreeableness also uniquely predicted higher HR and SI, while openness uniquely predicted lower HR, higher HRV, and lower SI. These findings are interpreted in the context of psychophysiological arousal, emotion-dysregulation, and stress-reactivity, their neurological bases, and their implications for mental, physical, and social facets of health.","Cultural appropriation is the act of taking, making us of, or imitation of a cultural product from an out-group that one does not identify with. The current research works examine the downstream consequences of exposure to acts of cultural appropriation on angry affect and affirmative action. Two experiments examined how perceivers respond to acts of out-group cultural use in various domains. In Study 1, White participants were exposed to a series of scenarios depicting out-group cultural use. Participants either read about White perpetrators engaged in cultural products associated with Black culture, or about Black perpetrators engaged in cultural products associated with White culture. Results from Study 1 demonstrated that reading about White perpetrators elicited greater angry affect than Black perpetrators. Study 2 examined how White and Black participants respond to acts of out-group cultural use to see if the perpetrator race effect on angry affect is unique to White participants. Study 2 also assessed endorsement of affirmative action policies in support of improving the status Black Americans. When reading about in-group actors engaged in use of Black culture (vs. out-group actors engaged in the use of White culture), White participants (but not Black participants) reported greater angry affect, and lower endorsement of affirmative action policies in support of Black Americans. This research illuminates how appraisals of cultural appropriation can facilitate a sense of anger and threat for White Americans. Implications for perceiving cultural appropriation for intergroup consequences are discussed.","The difference between anthropology and psychology in investigating emotion is considerable. Psychology focuses mainly on the individual psychological experiences of emotions, whereas anthropology deemphasizes the individual idiosyncrasies to give more attention to the articulation of the personal and social experiences withing contexts of broader societal and power dynamics, by putting an emphasis into the complexity of production of emotions in everyday contexts. I argue here that there is a need for a more anthropological view of emotions in our society to counterbalance the hegemonic view of psychology of emotions. The social and cultural interpretation of emotions in contemporary western societies is mainly based on their scientific understanding such as psychology and neuroscience. I want to discuss here about the necessity for a more broader understanding, in our society, of emotional related issues such as mental health, and to advocate for the need to inject an anthropological understanding and explanation of these issues in the public discourse.","Warm glow describes the phenomenon whereby acting pro-socially feels good. Here, we investigated the relationships between anticipated and experienced warm glow and pro-environmental behaviour and intentions. Study 1 (237 adults) measured real-time pro-environmental behaviour using the Carbon Emission Task, which involves trade-off decisions between bonus payment and environmental protection. Participants who made more conservation decisions (i.e., receiving less payment) experienced more warm glow. Study 2 (803 young adults) used the Work for Environmental Protection Task, a tedious and effortful task, as a stricter test of warm glow. Even in this boring task, people who completed more pages experienced more warm glow. Additionally, the effect of anticipated warm glow on experienced warm glow was partially mediated by pro-environmental behaviour. Study 3 replicated the mediation effects in a more generalized sample (953 adults). Moreover, it showed that people who anticipated more warm glow showed strongly costly (e.g. pay higher taxes) and general (e.g. take shorter showers) pro-environmental intentions, while experienced warm glow only influences general intentions. Together, these results demonstrate how pro-environmental behaviour can make us feel good, and point to a key role of anticipated feelings of warm glow in driving behaviour.","In outcome-selective Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT), conditioned stimuli (CS) predict specific outcomes and prime actions associated with these outcomes. This study expands the paradigm to explore fight-or-flight decisions. Participants first learned to either attack or retreat from animated monsters using a Sidman avoidance schedule during the instrumental phase. In the subsequent Pavlovian phase, they learned relations between specific environments and the appearance of certain monsters. During the transfer phase, participants chose between fight and flight to defend against invisible monsters, with intermittent CS presentations (environments without monsters). Study 1 found that CS presentations primed fight-or-flight decisions, demonstrating an outcome-selective PIT effect, and defensive actions compared to neutral CS, demonstrating an outcome-general PIT effect. Study 2 assessed the automaticity of the specific PIT effect under cognitive load and with instructions for the transfer phase where relations between CS and expected outcomes were verbally reversed post-training (between-manipulation). The results indicated a persistent fight-or-flight PIT effect with standard instructions and a reversed effect with reversal instructions. Notably, high cognitive load amplified the PIT effect in standard conditions but not with reversal instructions. Study 3 implemented a within-subject manipulation of high versus low threat. Results revealed a larger fight-or-flight PIT effect under low threat with standard instructions and no effect of threat level with reversal instructions. Collectively, these studies suggest that conditioned cues influence defensive action choices via activation of propositional knowledge structures. This knowledge retrieval is moderated by cognitive load and high threat, underscoring the complexity of cognitive and emotional influences in human defensive behavior.","The immersive nature of Virtual Reality (VR) offers unique and exploratory means to evoke empathy in ways previously unattainable. However, to produce successful social interventions, we need a foundational understanding of how empathy is best measured within a VR landscape. Our work reports on three studies that evaluate commonly used empathy measures, such as questionnaires and physiological measurements, and assess their ability to reliably measure empathy in VR. \n \n In the first study, scores on trait empathy questionnaires that are frequently cited in the literature were compared, exposing a lack of consistency in the structural frameworks of these questionnaires. For example, questionnaire subscales that were meant to assess cognitive, affective, and general empathy did not show consistent intercorrelations. \n \n Building on the insights from this study, the following studies investigate the relationships between physiological responses (I.e., galvanic skin response and heart rate measurements), trait empathy from a general questionnaire, and state empathy questionnaire responses within an empathy-inducing virtual reality paradigm. By exploring the convergence or divergence of physiological responses and self-reported empathy, this set of studies seeks to establish a more robust and integrated framework for assessing empathy in technologically enriched environments.","Background. Anticipatory affect and time pressure have been shown to impact decision-making under risk. In affect-rich choices participants pay less attention to probability-related information and switch from decision strategies that weigh all pieces of information (compensatory) to one that consider only one source of information (non-compensatory). Time pressure seems to have a similar impact on decision behavior. We thus sought to investigate the simultaneous impact of time pressure and anticipatory affect. \n \n Method. We used a risky choice paradigm in which participants (N=173) were requested to choose between lotteries that are rich (medial lotteries) or poor (monetary lotteries) in anticipatory affect. Participants were randomly allocated to a time pressure (i.e., instructed to make a choice as fast as they could) and a control group (i.e., instructed to take their time deciding). We used computational modeling to determine the best fitting decision strategy. \n \n Results. Most participants used a non-compensatory strategy in affect-rich compared to -poor decisions (X2= 90.53, p<0.001). This effect was not modulated by time pressure (X2=0.104, p=0.92). Participants made more risky choices in the affect-poor compared to -rich condition (F=21.445, p<0.001). This effect was primarily driven by a switch to non-compensatory strategy use. \n \n Conclusion. The impact of anticipatory affect on decision behavior was not significantly modulated by time pressure. Differences in risk taking across affect-rich and -poor choices are driven by changes in decision strategy.","Empathy is considered a virtue, yet it can be challenging to exercise when it is difficult or distressing to relate to people in need. Building on recent research on mindsets about empathy (Hasson et al., 2022), inducing the belief that empathy is unlimited may motivate increasing empathy in effortful situations. Undergraduates were randomly assigned to read articles portraying empathy as limited or unlimited (N = 153). They then completed the empathy selection task, a 25-trial where participants could choose whether to empathize with a target or simply describe their physical characteristics. We hypothesized that an unlimited mindset would be associated with more empathy, even when empathy is costly. Indeed, reading about an unlimited mindset increases beliefs about unlimited empathy (manipulation check on beliefs, p < .001). However, contrary to expectations, there was no main effect of the condition: the treatment did not significantly impact empathic effortful behaviors (p = .45). Nevertheless, in the unlimited condition, participants’ beliefs about empathy were more strongly related to empathic choices (a marginally significant slope, b = 1.64, p = .06) compared to those in the control condition (in which there was no significant slope, b = .51, p = .35; interaction p = .07). This study opens up additional research directions on the effect of mindset beliefs about empathy on empathic decision-making.","Habitual behavior has been identified as a key process involved in a variety of mental health disorders. Previous research has shown that habit is not a unitary construct. The present study examined how different components of habitual behavior relate to compulsive and problematic reward-seeking behavior. Four hundred and one participants completed a French version of the Creature of Habit Scale, which measures two components of habitual behavior: routine and automaticity. Participants also completed questionnaires assessing compulsivity, impulsivity, affective stress, and a variety of problematic reward-seeking behaviors, from which five transdiagnostic factors were extracted using an exploratory factor analysis. A dynamic network analysis indicated that the two habitual behavior components were differentially related to these transdiagnostic factors: routine was associated to compulsivity, while automaticity was associated to problematic media consumption. These findings suggest that taking the non-unitary architecture of habit into account may help to better understand the role of habit in mental health.","The blenderFace method is based on the open-source software Blender to precisely measure facial skin movements in video recordings, similar to motion capturing techniques used in the film industry. The process involves tracking markers placed on the facial skin using a pattern-matching algorithm, while effectively filtering out head movements. A significant advantage of the blenderFace method over automatic emotion recognition systems (e.g., AI-based systems) is its ability to record movement data not as classified emotions, but as raw x, y, and z coordinates for each frame. This data can then be subjected to detailed statistical analysis, allowing for a deeper theory-independend and pre-classification free understanding of facial cues in human interactions.\n In a first study (N = 106), we demonstrate the utility of the blenderFace method and present examples of statistical analyses that can be conducted using the data obtained. In a second study (N = 18) we used sunscreen painted markers only visible in the UV-range of light and videorecorded participants with two cameras in the visible and the UV-range of light. On the one hand,\n this modification facilitates a fair comparison of measurement precesion between the marker-based blenderFace method and marker-free AI-based methods (e.g., OpenFace) which are disrupted by visible painted markers. On the other hand, the adapted blenderFace method allows for an unobtrusive measurement of facial movements in dyadic interactions.","How does the emotional ambiguity influence our cognitive functioning (Brainerd et al., 2021)? Based on a recently proposed theory describing the dimensional ambiguity in emotions’ structure (Wielgopolan & Imbir, 2022), we differentiated the three spaces of ambiguity: ambivalence (positivity, negativity), origin (automaticity, reflectiveness), and activation (arousal, subjective significance). We hypothesized that stimuli ambiguous on every one of those spaces would have a different effect on our cognition. Using emotionally loaded words in the series of two experiments, we examined the effect of emotional ambiguity on the effectiveness of cognitive control using the simple Emotional Stroop Task (n = 60; Experiment 1) and its modified version with flankers (n = 60; Experiment 2). In both experiments, all groups of ambiguous words elicited significantly shorter reaction times than the control, unidimensional words. In Experiment 2, we observed significantly longer response times for incongruent compared to congruent trials. Additionally, in the incongruent trials, words with activation ambiguity produced reaction times significantly shorter than all other groups of words. These results show that the influence of emotionally ambiguous words (on three different emotional spaces) on cognitive control is significantly different than that of unidimensional words. It also further verifies the theory about the different kinds of emotional ambiguity.","There is emerging evidence that youth from immigrant families help their families navigate emotion-based communication. We refer to this assistance as emotion brokering, which is the process of helping someone understand the emotions of a person from a different culture. Research on other forms of brokering (i.e., interpreting language for others) suggests that frequent brokering for family members predicts greater familial conflict (Hua & Costigan, 2012). However, research has yet to examine the relationship between emotion brokering frequency and relationship quality. In this study, we examined (a) the association between emotion brokering frequency and relationship quality (i.e., relationship conflict and relationship support) and (b) the role of gender as a moderator of the relationship between emotion brokering frequency and relationship quality. A sample of Latinx college students (n = 118) reported their frequency of emotion brokering for their mothers and rated their levels of conflict and support in their relationship with their mothers. As expected, analyses revealed that emotion brokering frequency for the mother was associated with greater reports of maternal relationship conflict, but not maternal relationship support. However, analyses also revealed that the association between emotion brokering frequency and relationship conflict varied by gender. Specifically, emotion brokering frequency was only positively associated with relationship conflict among men in the sample (p = .005). These findings highlight that the process of helping others understand emotions is situated in the context of a relationship. The findings have implications for understanding how families adapt to the emotions of a different culture.","Jealousy is experienced in triadic contexts when an intimate relationship with a beloved is threatened by a rival (Campos et al., 2010). This powerful emotion is experienced by adults and children alike. While research typically examines individuals’ experiences of jealousy, less work has considered people’s perceptions of others’ expressed jealousy. We investigated 5-year-olds’ (N = 38), 7-year-olds’ (N = 37) and adults’ (N = 27) perceptions of others’ jealousy-like behaviors. \n \n Participants viewed animations of a central character cry for one individual (but not another) when the central character’s relationships with the social partner was threatened. Participants perceiving jealousy were expected to select that the target character preferred the person for whom they cried. Analyses indicated that 5-year-olds (13%, χ2 = 20.63; p < .001) and 7-year-olds (30%, χ2 = 6.08; p = .01) chose the expected option significantly below chance whereas adults chose the expected option significantly above chance (82%, χ2 = 10.70; p = .001). Adult performance was also significantly better than 5-year-olds (χ2 = 30.34; p < .001) and 7-year-olds (χ2 = 16.74; p < .001). Interestingly, 7-year-olds’ performance varied by child gender, with girls (44%) significantly more successful than boys (23%), χ2 = 3.63; p =.05.\n \n Thus, we conclude that children’s ability to understand others’ jealousy emerges around the age of 7 (with the ability emerging sooner in 7-year-old girls) and continues to develop as the individual reaches adulthood.","Despite the growing interest in workplace envy, empirical evidence regarding envy and employee performance is inconclusive. Integrating the social functional theory of emotions and self-regulation theory, we examine whether envy has a curvilinear relationship with performance and how this relationship is influenced by employee conscientiousness. In Study 1, using data from bank employees in Korea, we find that for employees who are higher on conscientiousness, envy has a curvilinear relationship with performance, such that the relationship is initially positive but becomes weaker and eventually disappears as envy increases further. However, for employees who are lower on conscientiousness, there is no relationship between envy and performance. Study 2, a three-wave study of sales and marketing employees from a healthcare company in the U.S., generally replicates the curvilinear moderated relationship. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our research.","Many affective processes, including emotion regulation, unfold over several seconds. This introduces a challenge for event-related approach often taken in EEG research. While typical ERP approaches enable investigation into temporal dynamics right after the onset of a stimulus, their sensitivity to more gradually unfolding processes is less optimal. At its core, ERP is merely a sudden change in stimulus contrast reflected in aggregated EEG waveform, which is, among other things, influenced by affective attention. Considering this, a potential solution would be to increase the number of these contrast changes in a unit of time, an approach known as SSVEP which provides an opportunity to conduct a query over a much longer time-window. In this study (N=44) we did just that; more specifically, we tested the feasibility of using a barely noticeable - and therefore less disturbing - periodic contrast modulation in the gamma range to probe variation in bottom-up capture of attention due to changes in affective content (negative vs. neutral) and the allocation of top-down attention (unregulated viewing vs. distraction) deployed towards the same stimuli. The time-frequency analysis based on rhythmic entrainment source separation revealed a sensitivity towards top-down attentional strategy, albeit in an unexpected direction (p<.001), but surprisingly, no significant interplay between affective content and EEG power at the tagged frequency (42.5 Hz) was apparent in our data (p>.05). This raises questions about the differential origins of these effects and about the feasibility of the high-frequency SSVEP in the context of emotion regulation.","This preregistered cross-sectional study investigated cultural differences in emotion beliefs and emotion regulation using measures that capture a wider range of emotion regulation strategies than previous studies. Young adults based in China (N = 161) and the UK (N = 155) completed questionnaires assessing independent and interdependent self-construals, beliefs about emotion controllability, usefulness and acceptability, and emotion regulation at the four stages of Gross’s (1998) process model. Chinese participants reported significantly higher controllability, usefulness, and acceptability beliefs for negative emotions and greater use of emotion regulation than British participants. In the combined dataset, independent self-construal significantly predicted use of emotion regulation strategies at all four stages whereas interdependent self-construal only significantly predicted response modulation. Further, controllability and usefulness beliefs predicted increased efforts in situation modification and attention deployment, controllability beliefs positively predicted cognitive change, and all three kinds of emotion beliefs positively predicted response modulation. There were also cultural differences in effects of emotion beliefs with acceptability having stronger effects on cognitive change in China and controllability only having a significant negative effect on response modulation in the UK. Further, our path model showed that all three beliefs mediated effects of independent self-construal on emotion regulation but only controllability beliefs mediated the effects of interdependent self-construal on emotion regulation. Our findings suggest that there are cultural differences in emotion beliefs, regulation strategies and the relations between them. Definitive evidence about causation will require further longitudinal research.","The role of emotions in learning is widely acknowledged in literature. According to Pekrun’s Control-Value Model, when learners perceive control over an activity, they are more likely to experience positive emotions, while the opposite holds true for negative emotions. Therefore, students’ achievement emotions during the learning process are influenced by their perception of control and the value they assign to the activity. Also, numerous studies support the idea that proficiency in L2 pronunciation significantly contributes to overall language learning competence. Despite the crucial roles of these variables (achievement emotions and pronunciation’s level), the majority of scientific studies on this topic often neglecting to consider these factors concurrently. Furthermore, most of studies have focused on university students or young adults while few evidence are available for younger learners. Following a previous longitudinal study where the authors highlighted an influence of metacognitive and emotional skills on English Vocabulary primary school’s participants, this study was aimed at investigating if the same relationship applies when considering L2 pronunciation. To this purpose, 130 second and third-grade students from Italian primary schools were involved. We assessed their pronunciation on a selected pool of English two-syllable words. Their phonological parameters were assessed and analyzed using the PRAAT software. Consistently with Pekrun’s Theory, and in accordance with our previous results on L2 vocabulary performance, our preliminary results seem to indicate an interconnectedness of metacognitive skills and achievement emotions in also predicting pronunciation of English as L2, starting from primary school. More studies on this topic are needed.","We present a novel observational tool designed for the standardized assessment of father-mother-adolescent conflict interactions, addressing a gap in existing instruments that predominantly focus on the mother-adolescent dyad through self-report measures. This study introduces and validates the Lausanne Trilogue Play – Conflict Discussion Task (LTP-CDT) and the Family Conflict and Alliance Assessment Scales – with adolescents (FCAAS-Ado). The task and coding system underwent testing with a sample of 82 family triads, consisting of the two parents and their adolescent child aged 10 to 13. Our findings demonstrate excellent inter-rater reliability for the coding system, and confirmatory factor analysis supports a robust two-factor structure of this new instrument. Criterion and construct validity were demonstrated through associations with self-reported marital satisfaction and coparenting. Furthermore, ecological validity for the LTP-CDT is established through family members’ self-reports regarding the typicality of their interactions. This tool holds promise for future research targeting diverse populations, for example low-income families or those with referred adolescents or parents, which will allow for the assessment of known-group validity for the FCAAS-Ado. The presentation discusses research and clinical implications of this innovative observational tool.","Prior research shows that hatred is an intensely negative emotion that is associated with perceiving someone as unchangeably malevolent, suggesting that people may not be able to stop hating someone. Yet is this really the case? The present research tested whether hatred could be reduced by changing the appraisals that research has shown contribute to causing hatred (e.g., perceived unchangeability and malevolence). A sample of 52 CloudResearch participants completed an online survey that asked them to describe two experiences of hatred (one about someone who is currently hated, and one about someone else who is no longer hated) and answer questions about their current thoughts and feelings. Results supported most of our hypotheses. For example, compared to people who are still hated, those who are no longer hated were perceived as less immoral, less evil, and were blamed less. In addition, participants who no longer felt hate perceived less dislike felt towards them than the participants who currently felt hate. Finally, our results for participant’s rated felt intensities of particular positive emotions (e.g., sympathy, compassion, and affection) and negative emotions (e.g., contempt, anger, and dislike) will be discussed.","In David Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature, “reason is and ought to be the slave of the passions.” The literature often ignores that this prioritization of emotion over reason follows Hume’s experiment on the square of passions comprised of pride and humility and love and hatred, each component formed by a double relation of ideas associated with a relation of impressions. The imagination, for Hume, is passive and unfixed, thus wildly unstable. However, the principles of association, which Hume claims as habit or reason, act as a stabilizing and gentle force that guides and assists this relation of ideas. The effects of these relations that replay and return upon the passive mind activate it to such an intense pitch that its ideas are perceived as impressions, which Hume labels impressions of reflection. The repetition changes nothing in the objects repeated, but it does make a difference in the mind that perceives it. The unsteadiness of the mind becomes constant and settled through repetition, and with the appearance of one object, in anticipation, the imagination immediately leaps to its frequently attending idea. This constant observation of habitual conjunction forms a belief, which converts what would be an idea into a feeling, that of a necessary connection. This feeling of necessity establishes an easy, smooth, and imperceptible transition from one idea to the next. The calm and steadying force of habit—exemplified in the square of passions—is why Hume places reason in a subservient, assisting role to our more violent emotions.\n \n Key words: Philosophy; Emotion Regulation; Emotion Theory; Habit; Passions; Reason; David Hume","Alexithymia (a difficulty identifying and describing emotions) has been linked to abnormal interoception, defined as the detection and interpretation of bodily signals. Both alexithymia and interoception have been suggested as potential explanations for the frequent comorbidity of autism and anxiety. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of how interoception and alexithymia may be linked to experiences of anxiety in autistic adolescents.\n \n Semi-structured interviews were conducted on thirteen British, autistic adolescents who reported experiencing significant anxiety. Initial patient and public involvement work was conducted to inform research design. Purposive sampling was used to generate a diverse sample. Interviews were analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis approach alongside during data collection, allowing for the information power approach to inform sample size. \n \n A key finding was the significant heterogeneity in how participants experienced both interoception and alexithymia. Some struggled to detect internal signals at all, which they related to a difficulty in recognising and thus regulating emotions. A number of these participants described being unable to discriminate between positive and negative emotions without using contextual cues. For others, especially those who experienced more general sensory hypersensitivity, bodily signals could become overwhelming, and were often the cause of catastrophising and subsequent anxiety. Both of these routes could lead to either meltdowns or shutdowns. However, some participants considered their experiences of interoception and alexithymia to be “normal,” and did not view it as affecting their anxiety.","In the Multi-Agent-Systems (MAS) literature, it is not rare to see coordination and cooperation interchangeably used. That drove us to reflect on the dichotomy between the two concepts, which can serve as a backbone to guide an intriguing investigation of empathy and decision-making. We are inspired by Malone and Crowston (1990), whose work provides examples of coordination and a framework to facilitate interdisciplinary transfers and the creation of cooperative tools. Hence, we started examining questions as below through the lenses of coordination vs. cooperation in MAS: What distinguishes coordination from cooperation? Why do you pick one instead of the other to characterize a task? Would you change your choice if focusing on the actor(s) making decisions instead of the task? What can be learned about empathy and moral decision-making as we investigate these questions? Is morality a combinatorial system?\n  More specifically, we are dissecting concepts related to homeostatic regulation, decision-making, environment, task, and affordances to create a framework for a mapping of ensembles. We are tracking definitions across concepts, disciplines, and experts to depict how they intercept visually – and we invite people across cultures to share their insights so that we can adjust this work accordingly.\n  In summary, we are examining multidisciplinary sources to create a cognitively grounded taxonomy and framework. We aim to help the MAS community easily identify a testbed to assess their affective-inspired computational approaches and to provide an additional resource for people interested in research on emotion. Finally, this invigorating work contributes to AI literacy efforts.","Hwang and Matsumoto (2012) demonstrated the distinguishability of triumph from pride expressions in Judo fighters. They identified three factors (Hwang & Matsumoto, 2014)— expansion, aggression, and attention—constituting triumph expressions, while pride was characterized by expansion and smiling.\n Our study aimed to determine the dominant emotion (triumph or pride) expressed in non-fighting, non-interactive sports, specifically elite high jumpers, utilizing the\n  Facial Action Coding System (FACS, Ekman, Friesen & Hager, 2002). \n Data from 66 elite high jumpers during their seasonal main event were analyzed, comparing conditions of successful clearance with bar failure and a baseline period. \n Triumph and pride were differentiated primarily by aggressive and expansive behaviors, respectively.\n Results indicate that triumph/aggression prevailed as the primary emotion/behavior post-bar clearance, with pride/expansion also more frequent than during baseline. \n However, pride/expansion levels failed to differentiate between bar clearance and failure. \n Notably, actions such as making a fist, shouting, lowering the eyebrows (Action Unit [AU] 4), and raising the upper lip (AU 10) occurred significantly more after successful bar clearance \n  than after failure.\n Regression analysis, using triumph as a criterion, predicted competition rank, seasonal best, personal best, and absolute height significantly. Pride frequency after clearance was predicted by height, personal best, and rank, excluding seasonal best. Triumph consistently had higher predicted variance than pride. PCA identified aggression/triumph and expansion/pride factors, introducing additional factors like social signals (including clapping), punching above the shoulders, and pointing. \n Results show triumph to be more related to success than pride, even in non-interactive sports competition.","Emotion regulation has traditionally been conceptualized as an intrapersonal phenomenon with a focus on individuals’ subjective experiences. However, emotions occur predominantly in the context of social interactions (Campos et al., 2011), particularly during emerging adulthood when individuals spend more time outside the family home. However, few studies have examined predictors of the use of different emotion regulation strategies in everyday life. \n \n Using Ecological Momentary Assessment (4 daily assessments across 14 days), we first examined concurrent associations between social contexts (closeness to interaction partner and pleasantness of interaction) and use of emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) among college students. Second, we used lagged models to investigate potential carryover effects of aspects of the social context on emotion regulation strategy use. \n \n Better quality of social interactions was associated with both less suppression and less reappraisal at the same moment (β = -.23, p <.001 and β = -.20, p <.001 for reappraisal and suppression, respectively), but not at subsequent moments (β = .02, p > .05 and β = .04, p > .05 for reappraisal and suppression, respectively). Interestingly, we found that reappraisal at one moment predicted more pleasant interactions and closeness at the next moment (β = .09, p = .004 and β = .09, p = .040 for pleasantness and closeness, respectively). Our findings underscore the importance of understanding both social contexts and emotion regulation on momentary levels. This study holds implications for understanding social context and emotion regulation in the everyday lives of emerging adults.","Previous studies have suggested that parents of children that have specific learning disorders (LD), dyslexia, dyscalculia, ADHD and developmental language disorder (DLD) exhibit higher levels of distress and a higher probability of being anxious, depressed and/or stressed than parents of typically developing children. This study investigated the emotion regulation and well-being of parents whose children have LD.\n \n Emotion regulation (DERS) and affective symptomatology (DASS) questionnaires were administered to 123 parents (106 mothers) in order to assess their emotion regulation and emotional well-being, respectively.\n Parents were divided in three groups: i) parents whose children have typical development (TD), ii) whose children have only one of these disorders (DLD, dyslexia, dyscalculia or ADHD) and a third group of iii) those who had children who had two or more of these LD.\n \n Parents whose children had at least two of the LD are the group that struggle the most regarding emotion regulation and more emotional symptomatology. That is, they showed statistically significant differences when it comes to DERS and DASS total scores compared to the two other groups. Furthermore, parents whose children had just one disorder exhibited more difficulties in emotion regulation and emotional symptomatology than the TD group and these differences were statistically significant.\n \n Our findings demonstrate that having a kid with a learning disorder involves more emotional suffering and more difficulties in parents’ emotion regulation. Furthermore, an increase in the number of children with learning difficulties leads to a significantly higher level of parent emotion dysregulation and emotional symptomatology.","Childhood emotional abuse can impact the development of empathy. To examine whether personality variables related to atypicalities in emotional awareness mediate this relationship, we had 499 participants (M = 20.2 years; 77.2% female) complete self-report measures of childhood emotional abuse, empathy and related constructs, alexithymia, and sensory processing sensitivity (SPS). We distinguished between an “adaptive” facet of SPS (being sensitive to subtle cues) and a potentially “maladaptive” facet (being sensitive to uncomfortable stimuli). Full mediation was supported in all tested models. Those reporting greater exposure to childhood emotional abuse scored higher on all three mediators (alexithymia and both facets of SPS). Both maladaptive and adaptive facets of SPS predicted stronger behavioural and emotional contagion (key variables thought to underlie empathy). Alexithymia interfered with, and SPS (particularly the adaptive facets), promoted the ability to understand and feel for other people. Both facets of SPS predicted the ability to imagine how fictional characters feel. Finally, feeling personal distress in tense interpersonal situations was positively mediated by alexithymia and maladaptive SPS traits, and negatively mediated by adaptive SPS traits. This latter finding suggests that alexithymia and maladaptive SPS traits interfere with the ability to self-regulate when seeing others who are suffering; this could limit one’s ability or desire to act with compassion. Overall, the findings suggest that aspects of personality are shaped by exposure to childhood emotional abuse, and that individual differences in the relative strength of specific traits linked to alexithymia and SPS are important determinants of variations in empathy-related constructs.","Past research showed that the cognitive reappraisal dimension of emotion regulation was associated with higher religiosity among Christianity, Islam and Judaism participants. In the current study, one hundred Hindus in North East India (Males = 48; Mean age = 25.42; age ranged from 20 to 32 years) responded to two religiosity scales (Attitude toward Hinduism Scale, Francis, Santosh, Robbins, & Vij, 2008; 20-item Dimensions of Religiosity Scale, Joseph & Diduca, 2007) and two measures of emotion regulation strategies (Gross & John, 2003; Garnefski & Kraaij, 2006). Results indicated that the earlier finding of the correlation between emotion regulation and religiosity is replicated. In particular, positive attitude toward religion, intrinsic religious orientation, extrinsic social religious orientation, extrinsic personal religious orientation, and other dimensions of religiosity (preoccupation, conviction, emotional involvement, and guidance) were significantly associated with many aspects of both the emotion regulation questionnaire and cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire. However, Gross and John’s emotion regulation questionnaire, which was utilized in both the present and past studies, yielded inadequate alpha reliabilities in the present data (α = >. 479 for cognitive reappraisal & .457 for emotional suppression). Nevertheless, Garnefski and Kraaij’s cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire provided acceptable alpha reliabilities (α = .72 to .79) except for the acceptance strategy of cognitive emotion regulation (α = .66). Thus, the present study extends the earlier findings on the relationship between religiosity and emotion regulation in various cognitive emotion regulation strategies.","Mathematical anxiety (MA) and mathematics performance typically correlate negatively in studies of adolescents and adults, but not always amongst young children, with some theorists questioning the relevance of MA to mathematics performance in this age group. Evidence is also limited in relation to the developmental origins of MA and whether MA in young children can be linked to their earlier mathematics performance. To address these questions, the current study investigated whether basic and formal mathematics skills around 4 and 5 years of age were predictive of MA around the age of 7–8. Additionally, we also examined the cross-sectional relationships between MA and mathematics performance in 7–8-year-old children. Specifically, children in our study were assessed in their first (T1; aged 4–5), second (T2; aged 5–6), and fourth years of school (T3; aged 7–8). At T1 and T2, children completed measures of basic numerical skills, IQ, and working memory, as well as curriculum-based mathematics tests. At T3, children completed two self-reported MA questionnaires, together with a curriculum-based mathematics test. The results showed that MA could be reliably measured in a sample of 7–8-year-olds and demonstrated the typical negative correlation between MA and mathematical performance (although the strength of this relationship was dependent on the specific content domain). Importantly, although early formal mathematical skills were unrelated to later MA, there was evidence of a longitudinal relationship between basic early symbolic number skills and later MA, supporting the idea that poorer basic numerical skills relate to the development of MA.","Cognitive reappraisal has been traditionally studied as an emotion regulation strategy for downregulating negative affect. In recent years, studies have demonstrated that cognitive reappraisal can be used for downregulating the desire to eat by reinterpreting thoughts regarding food and eating (e.g., thinking about the negative consequences of eating particular foods). Given that emotions and food craving are tightly linked, this study assessed the potential influence of food-related reappraisal on negative emotionality. The study included 40 healthy participants who performed a computerized task in which participants were presented with their own craved foods and were required to either watch these food items naturally or use food-related reappraisal to downregulate their desire to eat these foods. Then, participants rated their negative affect and desire to eat. Replicating previous results, participants successfully used cognitive reappraisal for downregulating their desire to eat their own craved foods. However, the results also demonstrated that food-related reappraisal increased negative affect. Despite previous suggestions regarding the potential of using cognitive reappraisal for treating obesity, the current study highlights the need to better understand potential costs of food-related reappraisal due to its potential negative impact on emotional well-being.","The project explored the perceptual-attentional limitation hypothesis in the discrimination between fear and surprise and the presence of a bias for the mouth. We also investigated if participants could be trained to focus on relevant cues (brows/mouth), and if that training would impact emotion discrimination accuracy. Participants completed a pre-test, a training, and a post-test (identical to the pre-test task). Participants viewed either pairs of fear expressions, or pairs of fear and surprise and were instructed to judge if the emotions were the same or different. The training phase for the experimental group was the same task but with feedback (correct or incorrect) after each trial. The control group completed an unrelated cognitive task. Experiment 2 followed the same procedure, but with different encoders in the training phase. This was done to circumvent the possible role of differing exposure to the stimuli between groups (experimental and control). The results from both experiments do not clearly support the presence of bias for the mouth; neither in accuracy, nor in time spent in the relevant areas. Results suggest that the perceptual-attentional limitation might be attentional rather than perceptual but, once again, other factors seem to come into play. In both experiments the experimental group was more accurate in the post-test, suggesting that the training improved accuracy and changed the focus of attention. These findings indicate that the confusion between fear and surprise is not due to irreversible limitations (e.g., biological factors) since individuals can be trained to improve their discrimination.","Research has documented the influence of “context” (e.g., posture, scene, voice, social cues) on emotion perception. However, another factor has received less attention: emoter race. Better understanding of how the race of the one whose emotion is being perceived may influence emotion categorization is of utmost importance.\n \n In two studies, two separate samples of 80 participants from a predominantly white U.S. university were shown fully crossed, photoshopped combinations of faces and postures posed by distinct actors of different races (Asian, Black, Hispanic, White) expressing anger, disgust, fear, sadness, and joy. Study 1 subjects were asked to categorize the emotion using forced choice. Study 2 subjects were recorded “telling a story” about each face-posture combination (shown in a random order for 30 s) and their narrations were transcribed and labels matching the face emotion were extracted and summed for analysis.\n \n For study 1, a repeated-measures GLMM revealed a significant Face ´ Posture ´ Race interaction predicting face categorizations, ps < .001, highlighting nuances in contextualized facial emotion perception. For instance, participants were equally as likely to categorize a Disgust-Anger face-posture combination as ‘disgust’ (M = 44%) or ‘anger’ (M = 42%) if the race of the emoter was white (p = ns). How, subjects were overwhelmingly more likely to categorize the same face-posture combination as ‘anger’ (M = 81%) than ‘disgust’ (M = 15%) if the emoter was Black (p < .001). A GLMM for study 2 partially confirmed this pattern (p = .007). Implications for emotion perception and anti-racist practices will be discussed.","One longstanding approach to shame construes it as a response to the public exposure of a personal defect, failure, or transgression. An alternative approach depicts shame as resulting from a broadly negative self-assessment that is internal and personal, not external and public. These approaches describe two contrasting emotions that could be called “public shame” and “private shame.” Private shame would involve judging oneself to be defective, contemptible, or inferior without feeling publicly exposed or worried about other people’s lowered esteem. Public shame would involve the reverse: recognizing that one faces public disapproval and reputational damage without losing self-esteem. I will present evidence from an American sample that both forms of shame occur. Occasionally one type of shame occurs in the absence of the other, but more often both forms occur simultaneously and I will discuss three reasons for their co-occurrence. (1) Perceiving one’s self to be flawed often gives rise to anticipation of public disapproval. (2) Public disapproval typically elicits some degree of personal concurrence. (3) Private and public shame are associated with individualist and collectivist cultures, respectively, but in all cultures people's self-concepts incorporate both independent and interdependent elements thereby allowing the experience of both private and public shame.","Moral events evoke emotions that shape situations. The morally outraged person may protest the violation; the morally disgusted may avoid the violator. Appraisals are key determinants of moral emotions. An appraisal perspective predicts an any-to-any relation between events and emotions: Any moral event could evoke any emotion, depending on how the person appraises the event. Appraisal accounts differ from traditional accounts of 1-to-1 correspondences between moral domains and emotions (Rozin et al., 1999), and constructionist theories that deny appraisal emotion links (Cameron et al., 2015). In four preregistered studies, we 1) assessed variations in participants’ emotion responses to moral violations from different moral domains (Graham et al., 2009; Rozin et al., 1999), and 2) examined participants’ corresponding appraisal dimension ratings (Lazarus, 2006; Piazza et al., 2019). Fit indices (AIC, and BIC scores) of Generalized Linear Mixed Models revealed that specific moral events predicted participants’ emotions better than moral domains for violations from both Rozin et al. (1999) and Graham et al. (2009). Further Mixed Linear Models found that all emotions (anger, disgust, surprise, sadness, fear) were positively associated with appraisal ratings of personal value and ‘no emotion’ responses associated with lower personal value ratings. Participant anger was also significantly associated with appraisals of predictability and preventability, while disgust and surprise had significant associations with unexpectedness appraisals. Further experimental evidence indicated that appraisal framings of moral and political events changed emotional responses. In support of appraisal accounts, results demonstrated that appraisals, not moral domains, accounted for emotional responses to moral events.","Cognitive appraisals are important in understanding consumer experiences as they have significant direct and indirect effects on consumer behavior. Despite the maturity of cognitive appraisal theory, much of consumer research focuses on the experiences and consequences of emotions without leveraging the literature on how antecedents (appraisals) of emotions can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of consumer experiences. This study aims to characterize specific emotions in terms of their appraisals and examine how appraisals differentiate emotions in the context of using expensive products/services. 700 participants recruited from Prolific recalled an experience of using an expensive product/service that they had purchased, and thereafter stated the dominant emotion (from a list of 8 emotions) felt and rated 20 appraisal dimensions of their experience. We found that appraisals such as control-self, fairness, and pleasantness have the least number of missing values (0.71-5.71%) compared to coping potential and appraisals relating to external accountability (11.79-16.36%), suggesting the differential relevance of appraisals in the consumption context. The 8 emotions have unique appraisal profiles and the accuracy of the 8-way emotion classification based on the 20 appraisal dimensions is 59.0%. Overall, the appraisal-emotion relationships are generally consistent with the appraisal literature, with some exceptions that might be novel to the consumption context (e.g. fairness and gratitude), which highlights the room for theoretical development in this context. This study has practical implications in fields like marketing and product design where understanding the antecedents of emotions in human-product interaction is critical.","In multimedia learning, emotional design is defined as the deliberate manipulation of design elements to induce emotional states conducive to learning (Plass & Kaplan, 2016). Although emotional design is supposed to increase visual attractiveness, no study has yet explored the effect of aesthetic value on learning. An experimental study (N=60) compared two versions of an instructional website including the same illustrations either with high aesthetic or low aesthetic visual design (as assessed in a preliminary study). Participants had to perform four information search tasks and a learning task. Data collected included performances, subjective evaluations (interest, user experience, cognitive load), and eye gaze. \n \n Results indicated that participants in high aesthetic condition expressed higher activated (t(58) = 2.06, p <.022) and maintained (t(58) = 2.86, p <.003) situational interest. In addition, user experience was enhanced in the high aesthetic condition (t(58) = 3.09, p = .002). Yet, there was no effect on learning performance and only one of the four information tasks lead to better scores in the high aesthetic version. There was no difference in extraneous cognitive load, measuring format-induced complexity, but the high esthetic version was perceived as more difficult (t(58) = 2.00, p = .05). Additionally, in the first 5 seconds, illustrations with low aesthetic design held attention longer (t(28) = -2.82, p = .004). Overall, the findings indicate that aesthetic visual design is a strong determinant of affective measures that are known to be associated with learning, though it may not have direct effect on short-term learning performances.","Fluctuations of affective states are a common everyday life experience which have been shown to influence cognitive performance. However, there is no consensus on the direction of this relationship; in fact, while some studies have found detrimental effects of negative and positive affective states on cognition, others reported cognitive improvements under either negative or positive affective states. The heterogeneity of the findings on affect-cognition interaction can be attributable to the variety of methods that have been used to induce affective states. Recent theoretical accounts propose that affective states can be mapped onto parameters derived from computational models applied to reinforcement learning tasks, such as expected reward and prediction error. As a consequence, reinforcement learning tasks can also be use to induce fluctuations in affective states. The present study intends to use a reinforcement learning task to manipulate the fluctuations in affect and link them to prospective memory retrieval, namely the likelihood of remembering intentions when specific conditions occur. The aim of the present study is two-fold. Firstly, it expects to find the specific computational properties of affective states, by linking participants’ self-reported affect to the parameters of a reinforcement learning model fit to participants’ data. Secondly, by linking the computational features of affect to prospective memory performance, it will provide new evidence on the relationship between affect and cognition. Data collection is still ongoing.","Decision confidence is a prototypical metacognitive representation as it has been shown to\n track the probability that a decision is correct in various computational models and\n experiments. Confidence has also been associated with affective valence, such that higher\n confidence is associated with more positive affect and vice versa. This suggests that similarly\n to confidence, in decision-making contexts affect could be a metacognitive signal reflecting\n the probability that a decision is correct. We tested this proposal in 2 perceptual\n decision-making experiments, where we investigated confidence and affect ratings in\n response to the probability that a decision is correct manipulated via expected and actual\n task difficulty. The findings indicate that confidence and affect ratings both track the\n probability that a decision is correct. We discuss various mechanisms and future directions\n that could clarify the cognitive and affective aspects of confidence.","When regulating their emotions, individuals choose distraction over reappraisal for high intensity negative stimuli and vice versa for low intensity negative stimuli (Sheppes et al., 2014). Presumably, they weigh the costs (e.g., effort to reappraise, Sheppes et al., 2014) and benefits (e.g., enduring effects of reappraisal on negative emotions, Thiruchselvam et al., 2011) of choosing each strategy, according to the context. However, the cognitive processes underlying such choices are not well-understood. Deliberate executive control processes may be engaged to override a tendency to disengage attention from intense negative stimuli (Sheppes et al., 2014). Accordingly, emotion regulation choice should be cognitively costly, particularly for high intensity stimuli. We tested this proposition in an experiment in which we manipulated stimulus intensity and cognitive load during emotion regulation choices. Adult participants (N = 65) learned how to implement reappraisal and distraction. After briefly viewing each of 60 negative images (30 low and 30 high intensity), participants viewed a display of a single digit (low cognitive load) or a series of five digits (high cognitive load). They chose between reappraisal and distraction before being prompted to enter the digits. Participants were more likely to choose distraction for high than low intensity stimuli, but there was no effect of cognitive load and no interaction. Decision times were slower under high than low cognitive load, but there were no other effects on decision times. Results suggest that emotion regulation choice is effortful, independent of stimulus intensity. Implications for the emotion regulation choice process will be discussed.","Theoretical models and previous evidence suggest that difficulty in regulating emotions might be involved in gambling, and that dysfunctional gambling behavior is associated to emotional (dys)regulation. Also, different games may elicit different emotions, and therefore being differently associated to emotion regulation. The aim of the study is to compare the emotions felt while gambling in three non-clinical subgroups: scratch-card, slot machine, and casino gamblers, games with a different collocation and perception on the chance-ability dimension. Participants (N = 425 gamblers, 45.7%F) contacted in three different contexts (scratch-card vendors N = 160, 56.9%F; slot machine venues, N = 129, 48.8%F; casino N = 136, 55.9%F) completed a questionnaire including the 2 question lie/bet instrument, a list of high/low arousal positive and negative emotions felt while gambling, locus of control. No gender differences emerged among the subgroup of players, while age is higher in casino players, followed by slot machine and finally scratch-card players. Main results confirmed that problematic gamblers have a less internal locus of control, alike to slot-machine and scratch-card gamblers compared to casino gamblers, who mainly chose games less associated to pure chance. Problematic gamblers feel more negative emotions and more high arousal positive emotions, the latter significantly more intense in scratch-card players, while negative emotions are higher in slot-machine players followed by casino and lastly by scratch-card players. Findings suggest considering gamblers as a heterogeneous group with respect to their search for emotions and, in addition, that regulation of positive emotions may play a central role in gambling.","The idea that love is a disposition, or involves dispositions, is not new…The problem is that nobody in the literature on love seems to have properly considered the question of what a disposition is and whether a better understanding of it can help us construct a plausible dispositional theory of love. (Naar 2013, p. 344)\n \n It is precisely this problem - what is a disposition (aka power) and what can the ontology of dispositions tell us about love’s nature – that this paper attempts to answers. I argue that if love is a power then, because it is a disposition, the starting assumption ought to be that it shares the qualities of powers. In particular, I examine three, uncontroversial properties of dispositions: (1) they have stimuli events and manifestations; (2) they exist independently of the actualization of those stimuli events/manifestations; and (3) they are massively multi-track. If love shares in these qualities, then it can, radically, exist without a beloved. In other words, there can be love even when this love is not of anything. This would fly in the face of nearly all current, philosophical, and scientific understandings of love. But, if it’s true, it would have significant consequences. For instance, it would suggest a type of expansive love that could be cultivated on one’s own. This, I submit, can be understood as a character trait – as being a loving person – or a more realistic and general way of conceptualizing agape (love of all humanity).","Previous neuroimaging research has demonstrated that the perception of emotional images elicits activity in brain regions related to the planning and execution of movements. However, little research has investigated whether these emotion-movement interactions occur at early or later stages of visual perception. In the current research, event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to examine the time course of the independent and combined effects of perceiving emotions and implied movement. Twenty-five participants viewed images from four categories: 1) emotional images involving a scenario that implied movement; 2) emotional images containing no implied movement; 3) neutral images involving a scenario that implied movement, and 4) neutral images with no implied movement. Both emotional stimuli and movement-related stimuli led to larger N200 (200-300 ms) ERP components. Furthermore, at frontal sites, there was a marginal interaction between emotion and implied movement, such that negative stimuli showed greater N200 amplitudes vs. neutral stimuli, but only for images with implied movement. The late positive potential (LPP; 500-1000ms) was significant for emotion (at frontal sites) and movement (at frontal, central, and posterior sites). The LPP also produced a significant interaction at parietal sites, with larger LPPs for negative vs. neutral images, but only if the images contained implied movement. Together, these results suggest that the perception of emotion and movement interact at later stages of visual perception. They also highlight the importance of controlling for implied movement when developing stimulus sets for affective neuroscience research.","Images generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been lauded as “art” that will replace human artists. Can the emotional payload of art be conveyed by a machine without emotional understanding? There is an implicit understanding between artist and viewer that art contains meaning and was created by an individual with whom empathy is possible. This discourse will explore three possible mechanisms through which AI-generated images elicit emotions, and whether each mechanism serves the same purpose as art. One potential is to see the machine as a transparent lens on the emotional context of the dataset that created it, in the way that a premodern artist was a transparent lens. The notion of an individual artist’s unique expression is barely half a millennium in development; throughout most of human history, individual expression was not seen as the emotional goal of art. Therefore, AI may fit the mold of premodern creator. A second possible emotional vector is that the viewer uses the image to perceive themselves, projecting their own context onto the image. Their emotional response is not predicated on any larger cultural context or empathy with the creator of the image. A third possibility is that there is an emotional understanding, real or imagined, within the machine. Only if the machine is emotionally aware can it serve the same purpose as the artist. The purpose of the artist is not to give an emotional hit; the purpose of the artist is to connect."]},"columns":[{"id":".details","name":"","type":null,"sortable":false,"resizable":false,"filterable":false,"searchable":false,"width":45,"align":"center","details":[{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["During social interactions, smiles provide information about a social partner’s affect and intentions.

For this study, we computed path analyses to identify both direct and indirect predictors of positive aspects of caregiving by mothers with a child with epilepsy. Our path model included sociodemographic, illness and mental health factors. A total of 168 women were recruited while attending the Pediatric Neurology Clinic at Soroka Medical Center, Be’er Sheva, Israel. This sample included 130 Jewish-Israeli and 38 Arab-Bedouin mothers caring for a child with epilepsy who completed parallel questionnaire batteries in Hebrew or Arabic. In our path model, burden is directly predicted by emotional exhaustion, (Arab) ethnicity, and the absence of social support and life satisfaction. Positive aspects of caregiving are directly predicted, in turn, by self-efficacy and (low) caregiver burden. Positive aspects of caregiving are indirectly predicted by (Jewish) ethnicity (via higher social support, life satisfaction and self-efficacy), lower illness severity and emotional exhaustion (via higher self-efficacy), and higher psychological well-being (via lower emotional exhaustion). Bedouin mothers reported greater illness severity, symptoms of depression and caregiver burden. Differences between groups in epilepsy severity suggest that less severe cases in the Bedouin community do not come to clinical attention (e.g., concealed due to stigma).

Uniquely, this data was analysed with ‘survival models’ which account for the statistical artefact that the exact point of participants’ limit for self-control could lie between two options. Results suggest that a greater reluctance to risk take is associated with less externalising or more internalising problems during adolescence, a comparative increase in internalising problems longitudinally and growing up in an economically deprived neighbourhood.

Curiosity is fundamental to how American journalism is taught, credited as a journalistic edge, the very impetus of story creation. But for academic analysis, classifying curiosity as a useful reporting tool does not engage with how journalists truly use it in practice. As I use it, curiosity is the emotion, experience, or desire to learn about something not immediately useful; it’s knowledge-seeking for some non-immediate need. Feature stories are explicitly set apart by their non-immediate-news nature. This gives features a specific posture toward exploring topics and events with a sense of curiosity.\n \n Drawing on a set of 18 semi-structured interviews with U.S.-based feature journalists and editors, this research explores how these professionals use curiosity to find story ideas by exploring news stories more in depth; by asking probing questions to themselves and to others; and by actively engaging with topics that are overlooked, underreported, or otherwise misunderstood.\n \n This research explores how a feature journalist’s phenomenological experience and professional performance of curiosity influences how she positions herself in the industry and engages her work.

One type of curiosity is “morbid curiosity” (MC), which is a dispositional approach-orientation to abnormal stimuli that many people find aversive (e.g., horrific violence, disgusting body violations). However, it is unclear if MC reflects positive responses to aversive stimuli (e.g., pleasure, excitement) or lower negative reactivity (e.g., reduced horror) that dampens the aversiveness. Given that MC is positively associated with sensation-seeking (Harrison & Frederick, 2020), and that sensation-seeking is associated with lower reactivity to stressors (Roberti, 2004), it is possible that MC may reflect lower arousal to typically aversive stimuli that allows people high in MC to enjoy exploring abnormal stimuli as novel items of interest with less of the aversive emotional responses that would reduce the pleasure of such exploration. \n \n METHODS: To explore MC’s association with negative emotional reactivity to abnormal harm, two repeated-measures studies were conducted online (N = 120). Participants read four tabloid headlines that described a real person being harmed in an abnormal way. After each, they rated how much horror (“horrified”, “shocked”, α = .82; measured on a 5-point Likert scale) and physical arousal (5-point visual Self-Assessment Manikin; Lang, 1980) the headline elicited. Lastly, they answered the Violence and Body Violations subscales of the Morbid Curiosity Scale (12 items, α = .92; Scrivener, 2021). \n \n RESULTS: In General Estimating Equations analyses, horror was negatively predicted by MC, B_study1 = -.26 [95%CI: -.44, -.08], B_study2 = -.36 [-.59, -.13], and positively predicted by arousal, B_study1 = .77 [.67, .86], B_study2 = .62 [.47, .78]. But when MC and arousal were entered as simultaneous predictors of horror, the association between MC and horror was mediated by arousal, B_study1 = -.13 [-.31, .05], B_study2 = -.22 [-.44, .00]. \n \n DISCUSSION: This suggests a physiological component to MC, whereby MC was associated with lower arousal in response to unpleasant stimuli, which in turn dampened aversive feelings of horror. Thus, horrific events that low-MC people might experience as aversively abnormal, high-MC people may experience as interesting novelty that stimulates the approach motivation of curiosity."]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["To date, studies have not consistently provided evidence for age differences in emotion regulation.

Participants completed a ten-day daily-diary procedure with measures of daily interpersonal capitalization, positive affect, perceived burdensomeness, and loneliness as a proxy for thwarted belongingness. Within-person analyses examined the associations of daily capitalization with burdensomeness, loneliness, and positive affect across groups.\n\nResults: Only the higher-risk group reported lower perceived burdensomeness and loneliness on days where they engaged in more capitalization. While higher capitalization was associated with higher positive affect in both groups, the higher-risk group benefitted from larger increases in positive affect in response to capitalization.\n\nConclusion: Engaging in daily interpersonal capitalization may be useful to reduce daily thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness and increase positive affect among adolescents at higher risk for suicidal ideation."]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["The brain processes underlying the distinction between emotion-label words (e.g., happy, sad) and emotion-laden words (e.g., successful, failed) remain inconclusive in bilingualism research.

The imagination, for Hume, is passive and unfixed, thus wildly unstable. However, the principles of association, which Hume claims as habit or reason, act as a stabilizing and gentle force that guides and assists this relation of ideas. The effects of these relations that replay and return upon the passive mind activate it to such an intense pitch that its ideas are perceived as impressions, which Hume labels impressions of reflection. The repetition changes nothing in the objects repeated, but it does make a difference in the mind that perceives it. The unsteadiness of the mind becomes constant and settled through repetition, and with the appearance of one object, in anticipation, the imagination immediately leaps to its frequently attending idea. This constant observation of habitual conjunction forms a belief, which converts what would be an idea into a feeling, that of a necessary connection. This feeling of necessity establishes an easy, smooth, and imperceptible transition from one idea to the next.

I argue that if love is a power then, because it is a disposition, the starting assumption ought to be that it shares the qualities of powers. In particular, I examine three, uncontroversial properties of dispositions: (1) they have stimuli events and manifestations; (2) they exist independently of the actualization of those stimuli events/manifestations; and (3) they are massively multi-track. If love shares in these qualities, then it can, radically, exist without a beloved. In other words, there can be love even when this love is not of anything. This would fly in the face of nearly all current, philosophical, and scientific understandings of love. But, if it’s true, it would have significant consequences. For instance, it would suggest a type of expansive love that could be cultivated on one’s own. This, I submit, can be understood as a character trait – as being a loving person – or a more realistic and general way of conceptualizing agape (love of all humanity)."]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["Previous neuroimaging research has demonstrated that the perception of emotional images elicits activity in brain regions related to the planning and execution of movements. However, little research has investigated whether these emotion-movement interactions occur at early or later stages of visual perception. In the current research, event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to examine the time course of the independent and combined effects of perceiving emotions and implied movement. Twenty-five participants viewed images from four categories: 1) emotional images involving a scenario that implied movement; 2) emotional images containing no implied movement; 3) neutral images involving a scenario that implied movement, and 4) neutral images with no implied movement. Both emotional stimuli and movement-related stimuli led to larger N200 (200-300 ms) ERP components. Furthermore, at frontal sites, there was a marginal interaction between emotion and implied movement, such that negative stimuli showed greater N200 amplitudes vs. neutral stimuli, but only for images with implied movement. The late positive potential (LPP; 500-1000ms) was significant for emotion (at frontal sites) and movement (at frontal, central, and posterior sites). The LPP also produced a significant interaction at parietal sites, with larger LPPs for negative vs. neutral images, but only if the images contained implied movement. Together, these results suggest that the perception of emotion and movement interact at later stages of visual perception. They also highlight the importance of controlling for implied movement when developing stimulus sets for affective neuroscience research."]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["Images generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been lauded as “art” that will replace human artists. Can the emotional payload of art be conveyed by a machine without emotional understanding? There is an implicit understanding between artist and viewer that art contains meaning and was created by an individual with whom empathy is possible. This discourse will explore three possible mechanisms through which AI-generated images elicit emotions, and whether each mechanism serves the same purpose as art. One potential is to see the machine as a transparent lens on the emotional context of the dataset that created it, in the way that a premodern artist was a transparent lens. The notion of an individual artist’s unique expression is barely half a millennium in development; throughout most of human history, individual expression was not seen as the emotional goal of art. Therefore, AI may fit the mold of premodern creator. A second possible emotional vector is that the viewer uses the image to perceive themselves, projecting their own context onto the image. Their emotional response is not predicated on any larger cultural context or empathy with the creator of the image. A third possibility is that there is an emotional understanding, real or imagined, within the machine. Only if the machine is emotionally aware can it serve the same purpose as the artist. The purpose of the artist is not to give an emotional hit; the purpose of the artist is to connect."]}]}]},{"id":"Nb","name":"Nb","type":"numeric","maxWidth":50},{"id":"Title","name":"Title","type":"character","minWidth":400},{"id":"Authors","name":"Authors","type":"character","minWidth":200},{"id":"Abstract","name":"Abstract","type":"character","show":false}],"searchable":true,"pagination":false,"highlight":true,"dataKey":"6ccb9b61a5864e11b590e7d3b2d1187b"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
