We used heartrate variability (HRV) as a measure of physiological arousal throughout the reading paradigm. We found that emotionally transporting oneself into a story produced greater levels of personal distress, allowing for individuals to see themselves in the place of the story’s characters. There were increases in sympathetic activation dependent on both prior levels of empathy and state-levels while reading. Results of the study suggest empathy provides a mechanism for individuals to connect to others on a cognitive, affective, and even behavioral level. To empathize with someone is to understand their perspective and to experience another’s emotions. Narrative transportation is a combination of attention, imagery, and feelings, in which an individual becomes immersed in a narrative world, influencing beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors towards others. Transportation into a narrative is an effective way to establish and even stimulate feelings of empathy and emotional connection. This provides us with opportunities to develop curricula or interventions that foster empathetic responses. If empathy can be taught, then methods can be established that effectively reduce feelings of hatred or bias towards others. Individuals who are more transported are more likely to adopt beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that are adapted to fit the narrative. By providing individuals with the opportunity to change or adapt their feelings, society can move forward, reducing negative attitudes towards others and creating a more balanced environment with acceptance and empathy.","Hookup culture's middle ground of \"undefined\" romantic relationships (talking to, hanging out, hooking up, etc.) offers an agentic realm for the study of emotion signals as predictors of relational change. I explore the interconnection of self, identity, and emotion by generating and empirically testing novel theoretical predictions concerning felt-emotion feedback and its deviation from expectation as an indicator of future relationship change in a longitudinal sample of young adults in defined (N=50) and undefined (N=43) relational dyads. Through MANOVA, two-sample t-test, regression, and structural equation model analyses conducted using variables of respondent identities and emotions, affect control theory-computed emotions, and variables of respondent identity discrepancy (squared Euclidian distance between affective ratings of personas (true selves) and relational selves (selves in relationship)) and emotion discrepancy (squared Euclidean distance between affective ratings of respondent emotion expectations and respondent emotion experiences), I find that (1) undefined relationship labels are affectively distinct and culturally shared, (2) affective ratings of personas do not differ by cultural framework while those of relational selves do, (3) identity discrepancy and emotion discrepancy have a positive and statistically significant correlation (respondents seek to affirm personas, not relational selves), (4) relationship emotional optimism (evident in computations for both defined and for undefined relationship participants) is justified in defined, but not undefined, relationship experiences, and (5) identity discrepancy-generated emotion signals account for a 17% reduction in the direct effect of relationship type on relationship dissolution likelihood: empirical evidence that emotion signals in the present significantly influence relationship behaviors in the future.","Human brains evolved to utilise goal-relevant information and therefore likely implement multiple mechanisms to retain such information preferentially and to retrieve it in relevant contexts. Recent context Maintenance and Retrieval models (eCMR and CMR3) bring some of these mechanisms within a single formal framework to explain the dynamics of recalling personally meaningful information. The models predict increased recall of emotionally negative information as well as the specific dynamics of the recall output. Here we test whether these predictions are confirmed for real-world stimuli with emotional significance. A sample of participants who reported that the war in Ukraine was personally relevant to them were asked to view sets of very negative and less negative photographs of the war, all taken from Instagram accounts of European correspondents, and then described what they recalled from these images. The data confirmed two key predictions of the models: participants recalled those photographs studied closer in time to each other contiguously, and they recalled more of the very negative photographs. However, in contradiction to the prediction of the models, participants did not recall those more negative images contiguously. Follow-up work explored the reasons this effect was not observed by differentiating between the global, visual, emotional and semantic similarity of images to understand the underlying reasons for clustering in recall of complex novel scenes. Taken together, the results support eCMR as a model of recall of goal-relevant information, but also point to limitations in its ability to simulate strategic encoding processes.","Humans are in general willing to demonstrate prosocial behavior if they can prevent harm to others. However, to what extent pro-social behavior involves less controlled cognitive processes when aiding others remains unclear. Here we examined the impact of threat exposure to an anonymous other on stimulus-driven attention. Participants performed an exogenous spatial cueing task in dyads whilst their performance determined if electric shocks were delivered as punishment. The experiment was conducted under three conditions: when participants themselves were under threat, when an anonymous co-participant was under threat, and under no threat conditions. In both threat of shock conditions, participants were faster in orienting and reorienting than in the no threat condition. Importantly, this enhanced performance was not due to a speed-accuracy trade off. Moreover, this behavioral improvement was associated with increased pupil dilation in both threat of shock conditions. Together, these findings suggest that engaging in pro-social behavior when others are in danger enhances automatic attention and triggers autonomic responses at a level comparable to when individuals themselves are under threat.","We report on the opinions that visitors of a public museum stated after having interacted, actively or passively, with a our very humanlike, android robot \"Andrea\". It is a human-sized, sitting android robot with a total of 52 pneumatic actuators that can be programmed to move the upper body, its fingers and hands, its head, and its face including the eyes. It was installed in the museum for six days from end of October to beginning of November 2023. Visitors could interact with the robot by pressing a button to start the audio recording and releasing it to start the audio processing. A combination of machine learning algorithms then generated a response that was played back as audio in synchrony with an auto-generated animation of the robot's face. In total, 44 structured interviews were conducted asking the visitors to describe their respective interaction, rate the usefulness of the android in its current version, and comment on future scenarios that they either judge appropriate or inappropriate for the android in the museum. Also, we asked which parts needed to be improved before the android could be employed in the museum again. \n The results suggest that the visitors had a predominantly positive opinion about Andrea. A minority of the visitors were concerned about the risk that such robots could substitute humans in the workplace. Some also reported feeling uncanny. The majority, however, could imagine that such a robot could fulfill a certain purpose in the museum after the response time has been improved and multi-language support implemented. To the best of our knowledge this was the first time that an interactive, fully autonomous android robot has been installed and evaluated in a public space in Europe, if not in the world.","Language is a powerful means for us to regulate each other’s emotions, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to help people achieve better emotional well-being—but we must do so scientifically and ethically. We describe a multi-step (and multi-paper) research program using LLMs, combined with psychological theory, to offer targeted reappraisals—alternative ways of evaluating a situation that result in better well-being—via a novel neurosymbolic approach. First, we show that LLMs can accurately identify a narrator’s cognitive appraisals from text, for example, feeling like they were causally responsible for a negative event). Next, we leverage empirical data from a recent meta-analysis as weights in a model to select the most relevant appraisals to target. That is, if the narrator is feeling guilt and we would like to help them downregulate, we could target the self-responsibility appraisal. Finally, we prompt the LLM to generate a targeted reappraisal, and compare these with human responses, baseline model responses simply prompted to generate an empathic response without mention of appraisal, and models using other prompting strategies. At each step, we discuss our evaluation strategy, which is crucial to establish scientific validity. We highlight gaps between current model capabilities and human-level emotional intelligence, and we end with thoughts about deploying such systems ethically. This work has the potential to inform emotionally intelligent (and empathic) conversational agents that could help people live emotionally healthier lives.","Epistemic emotions refer to emotions triggered by information, its qualities or the processing of information. In an fMRI study on 104 healthy adults we mapped the cortical topographies of appraisals, basic and epistemic emotions. Here, we only discuss the findings related to epistemic emotions. Results suggest that curiosity and interest are differentially represented in the brain. Excitement, interest, surprise and enjoyment all displayed similar activation maps. Amygdala, thought to reflect perceived relevance, was active in interest, surprise and enjoyment. Implications for relevant theories of the field are discussed.","Alexithymia is a trait characterized by difficulties identifying and describing feelings and by an externally oriented thinking (EOT) style; however, whether alexithymia is also associated with a deficit in fantasizing abilities as originally postulated is unclear. In two studies, we investigated whether links between EOT and fantasizing are mediated by sensory processing sensitivity (SPS). University students completed self-report measures of alexithymia, SPS, and fantasizing. In Study 1 (N = 700) we identified two clusters of SPS traits: a positive facet (sensitivity to subtle sensory cues) and a negative facet (sensitivity to uncomfortable sensations). In the 499 participants who completed the fantasy measure, we found that those who turned their attention inward (low EOT) reported stronger SPS positive traits and that this predicted a stronger tendency to imagine how fictional characters feel. In Study 2 (N = 600), we showed that the link between EOT and this tendency was mediated by emotional reactivity and fantasy proneness. We suggest that having an impoverished fantasy life mainly characterizes alexithymic individuals who score high on EOT. We argue that alexithymic individuals who score relatively low on EOT and are highly sensitive to subtle stimuli (including internally generated mental images) display fantasy proneness and develop a cognitive style characterized by using imagery-based strategies for reasoning and problem solving. As a result, they tend to become deeply absorbed in books, plays, and movies and find it easy to imagine what the characters are thinking and feeling. These studies clarify the relationship between alexithymia and fantasy impairment.","The term psychological resilience is often limited by the lack of consensus surrounding what exactly researchers are referring to when they use the term resilience. Debates and contradictions within psychological resilience literature threaten the utility of the term. A total of 22 experts from within the field of resilience research were recruited to partake in an online e-Delphi with the aim of reaching a consensus on items that could help define resilience. The items included in this Delphi study were derived from the literature and generated by participants in the study. The items were rated based on their essentiality to defining resilience with 13 reaching the pre-set requirements. Of these 13 items, 4 were deemed essential to defining resilience and 9 were deemed non-essential. Referring to resilience as a trait was largely rejected. The view that resilience is a dynamic and multifactorial concept was preferred by this expert group. This study provides a discussion of these items in relation to the wider literature and potential direction for future research and debates on this topic.","Studies distinguish different types of envy. For example, all Russian methods of envy research focus on its destructive manifestations. However, there is another point of view on the manifestations of envy. In foreign sources it is accepted to distinguish between benign and malicious envy. Our goal was to find out what kind of envy will be triggered among the Russian-speaking sample (N=72) on the example of evaluation of material and experiential purchases in social networks and to identify the distinctive properties of envy. Participants were required to complete several questionnaires about envy and rate envy of material and experiential purchases (Lin, Van de Ven, Utz, 2017). Statistical analysis showed that experiential purchases trigger more envy among the purchases, despite the equality in price. The hypothesis of a negative correlation between the propensity to materialism and envy of experiential purchases was not confirmed, because, on the contrary, a positive correlation between the two scales was obtained, and the strength of the correlation between the scale of materialism and the scale of envy of experiential purchases is stronger than in relation to material purchases.","Three decades of research in cultural psychology show that viewing the self as independent vs. interdependent powerfully shapes emotional experiences. One hallmark of the interdependent self is the tendency to be self-effacing and hold a weaker positivity bias in emotional experiences in order to promote social harmony. However, the basis for this conclusion was drawn by comparing East Asians, a more interdependent group, to European Americans, a prototypically independent group. Thus, our current understanding of interdependence is conflated with the specific way in which interdependence is achieved in East Asia. To test whether this effect generalizes to other interdependent groups, we compared 100 Mexicans living in Mexico (an understudied interdependent group) with 100 European Americans living in the U.S. Participants were recruited through Prolific and completed a modified version of the Affect Valuation Index (AVI). Participants were asked about how often they felt, wanted to feel, and wanted to avoid a series of positive and negative emotions that varied in whether they promoted independence (socially disengaging emotions) or interdependence (socially engaging emotions). As predicted, Mexicans participants wanted to avoid negative emotions more than European Americans particularly those that were socially disengaging, such as anger and pride. We found no cultural differences for the avoidance of positive emotions. This work contributes to research on culture and emotion by showing that Mexicans have a style of interdependence characterized by the avoidance of negative and independence-promoting emotions.","Although norms are essential for the functioning of society, norm violations commonly occur. Whether norm violations spread or are contained likely depends on the emotions elicited by them. Here, we will examine perceived emotional reactions and behavioral intentions in response to norm violations. The study will be a between-subjects survey, and participants will be UK citizens recruited through Prolific. Participants will read a description of a norm violation, and the disruptiveness, threat, and benefit of the norm violation will be manipulated across conditions. Using an intersubjective approach, participants will rate the emotions that they believe observers witnessing the norm violation would experience. Participants will also rate the behavioral tendencies they believe the observers would undertake (opposition, acquiescence, and support). We predict that when the norm violation is disruptive it elicits anger, when the norm violation is threatening it elicits fear, and when the norm violation is beneficial it elicits admiration. We further hypothesize that anger predicts opposition of the norm violation, that fear predicts acquiescence, and that admiration predicts support of the norm violation. Participants will also complete the Brief HEXACO Inventory to measure personality, the Short Schwarz Value Survey, and a measure of (economic and social) political orientation. Data collection is about to commence and the study is to be completed in early 2024. These results will give insight into the emotional dynamics of norm violations, and help to understand how emotions elicited contribute to the spread or containment of norm violations.","There are numerous studies showing that emotional states impact the breadth of attention. However, recent inconsistent results in high-powered studies raise the question of what kind of emotional state robustly influences the breadth of attention. In two web-based experiments, we used two different types of emotion manipulations with complementary strengths to explore this relationship. In Experiment 1 (n = 193), we used autobiographical recall to elicit a personally relevant emotional experience. In Experiment 2 (n = 200), we used viewing emotional images to elicit more immediate and less variable emotional experiences that may lack personal relevance. Importantly, in neither experiment did we observe any emotion effects on the breadth of attention measured by the Navon task. These findings add support to the growing number of failed attempts to replicate the emotion effect on the breadth of attention. The findings also highlight that it is still necessary to clarify which kind of emotional state robustly influences the breadth of attention, as the relationship appears to be weaker than expected based on the literature.","The Coronavirus pandemic has brought different discussions about how nature works to the fore (e.g., “Nature has a balance, but if you ruin it, it takes revenge”). As the pandemic is considered a natural disaster, its potential to induce awe about nature, particularly threat-based awe, has also come to the fore. In the current study, we investigated whether the different types of awe would mediate the relationship between perceptions about nature (balance of nature and punitive nature) and support for pro-environmental policies. We conducted three correlational studies. We run Study 1 in Turkey (N = 1305), Study 2 in the U.S. (N = 212), and Study 3 in the U.K. (N = 600). Results showed that belief in natural balance was a stronger predictor of positive awe than threat-based awe. Belief in a punitive nature positively predicted threat-based awe. Only positive awe emerged as a significant mediator between perceptions about nature and policy support. In sum, this set of studies points out the importance of considering types of awe and their relationships with beliefs about nature in understanding attitudes toward environmental policies, especially during natural disasters.","Mothers and their children 3-4 years old were recruited to participate in a reading activity, where mothers read an emotion-focused story to their children (N = 24). This was followed by a brief conversation where mothers were asked to discuss five questions about the book with their children. These interactions were recorded and coded by trained research assistants, where maternal and child vocal affect was categorized and measured by overall maternal vocal affect, as well as how sad, frustrated, and happy they sounded. A correlational analysis found that the overall affect of children was significantly correlated with overall affect of mothers (r(22) = .48, p < .05), happy affect of children was significantly correlated with happy affect of mothers (r(22) = .64, p < .01), and sad affect of children was significantly correlated with frustrated affect of mothers (r(22) = .71, p < .01). These findings demonstrate that the affect in which a mothers speaks is associated with the affect in which their children speaks, further suggesting mothers may have a significant emotive influence over their children. Mothers’ speech was also measured in total number of utterances as well as number of emotion-focused words spoken. A summary analysis showed that approximately half of the utterances mothers spoke were made up of emotion-focused words, suggesting a high level of conversation was based on discussing feelings. While these overall findings should not be interpreted as causal, these results may indicate the importance of maternal emotional expression when interacting with children.","Microexpressions are brief facial expressions that reveal true emotions, particularly in situations where individuals are trying to conceal them. Researchers and practitioners find these expressions valuable for gaining insight into hidden emotional states. Detecting microexpressions requires either manual approach or automated approaches. Manual detection involves trained observers who analyze high-speed video recordings, while automated detection uses computer software that analyzes facial movements. However, the relative advantages of these approaches are unclear.\n This study compares the effectiveness of manual and automated approaches in detecting microexpressions. The study characterized microexpressions by their brief duration, subtle facial muscle movements, and occurrence in response to emotional stimuli. The detection of microexpressions requires specialized training and equipment. \n Manual detection involves trained observers who analyze high-speed video recordings to identify microexpressions. Observers undergo specialized training to recognize microexpressions accurately, with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) being a common approach to manual detection. Automated detection involves the use of computer software to extract, analyze facial movements and identify microexpressions.\n Result of this study discusses and compares the accuracy, efficiency of manual and automated approaches in detecting microexpressions. \n In conclusion, the study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of manual and automated approaches in detecting microexpressions. Researchers should consider these factors when choosing a detection method. A combination of both approaches may yield the most accurate results.","Children and adolescents with different neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Specific Learning Disorders (SLD), might experience emotional dysregulation during social-evaluative threat. Within an evolutionary framework, heart rate variability (HRV) has been described as a biomarker of social functioning. The aim of the study was to investigate subjective and autonomic responses towards social stress in youth with and without these conditions. The study involved 55 participants aged 10-16 years old divided into three groups: 15 with ASD, 15 with SLD, and 25 non-diagnosed (ND) matched peers. We asked participants to complete a social performance task adapted from the Trier Social Stress Test, during which we registered the electrocardiogram to measure psychophysiological responses (HR, RMSSD - a measure of HRV) across all phases of the protocol: baseline, preparation, public speech, recovery (i.e., phase). Participants were asked to report their subjective experiences (valence, arousal, perception of competence, worries) before and after the public speech. Linear mixed-effects models were run to examine the predictive role of phase, group, and phase*group, on subjective and autonomic responses. Significant interaction effects of phase*group resulted for valence, χ2(df=2)=6.66, p=.03 (ASD>ND), perception of competence, χ2(df=2)=8.83, p=.01 (ASD>SLD, ND), and HR, χ2(df=6)= 13.49, p=.03 (HR change: ASD<SLD). Results also showed a trend towards significance for the effect of group for arousal, χ2(df=2)=5.51, p=.05 (ASD<ND), and of phase*group for RMSSD, χ2(df=6)= 12.28, p=.05 (baseline, recovery, change: ASD<SLD). All in all, findings suggest that the three groups might experience unique subjective responses, and specific patterns associated with autonomic flexibility towards social stress.","Hate speech, defined as speech that incites, spreads, justifies hatred, discrimination or violence against specific individuals or groups poses a serious challenge to society. Despite increasing interest among researchers in the field of affective computing, almost all studies to date have used written contents (i.e., “hate text”), rather than spoken content aka “hate speech”. As automatic crawling and content moderation largely depend on text, this renders collecting genuine acoustic signals of hate speech from social networking sites (SNS) essential. We compared current keyword-based crawling for hate speech (7 hours of audio) from two SNS (YouTube, BitChute) with a more targeted channel-based approach (257 hours of audio). This latter approach focuses on the personal channels of individuals suspected of spreading hate speech included in a public listing (www.wikipedia.com). Our preliminary results for keyword-based crawling (7 days) revealed more hits on BitChute (8 out of 59 samples; 14%) than on YouTube (no hits), despite a much smaller overall volume of BitChute posts. However, in an initial balanced annotation (80 of 1290 videos) over 4 different personal BitChute channels, we identified hate speech in 54% of the examined auditory samples. We speculate that these results may reflect a consequence of hate speech posters learning to avoid certain keywords in the title and metadata of their posts. Going forward, we discuss how data-crawling could be improved through generating updated keywords from automatically transcribed auditory speech from channel-based approaches. We conclude with discussing implications and challenges of multimodal crawling for hate speech on the Internet.","Stigma research usually focuses on the general positive and negative feelings that individuals have towards the stigmatized group. However, examining specific emotions like shame, guilt, disgust, and contempt can provide unique information about appraisals and motivations. We surveyed a sample of mental and physical healthcare providers in the southern United States. The providers were asked about their thoughts, feelings, and motivations towards patients with Opioid Use Disorder, including specific emotions these healthcare providers felt when thinking about working with patients who use heroin. Consistent with theories about self-conscious emotions, healthcare providers’ shame (but not guilt) was uniquely associated with more negative cognitions such as moral disengagement and negative medical condition regard, as well as weaker recommendation of medication-assisted treatment and stronger perception of opioid addiction as being the result of moral failings. Comparing between two downward-facing social emotions, disgust and contempt, disgust was associated with much stronger negative attitudes and motivations. For example, greater disgust (but not contempt) was associated with lower support for medication-assisted treatment and less willingness to accept a patient who used heroin to be scheduled at their healthcare practice. Although pity can be considered a prosocial emotion, pity was one of the strongest and most consistent predictors of stigmatizing beliefs. Such a negative pattern is consistent with Fiske’s Stereotype Content Model, which conceptualizes pity as prejudice towards groups with low perceived competence. These findings provide a unique test of specific emotion theories in an applied context with implications for stigma reduction efforts.","Alterations in the perception of facial emotional expression and their physiological resonance, as well as in accurately sensing bodily states (i.e., interoception), have been reported in both individuals on the autism spectrum and individuals with social anxiety. Yet, despite the rise of embodied perspectives on emotion processing, past studies have mostly investigated them separately. In the current study, we aimed to examine the association between physiological responses, their sensation, and facial emotion perception in the two clinical conditions and neurotypical, healthy controls. Individuals on the autism spectrum (N = 40), with a diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder (N = 27) and with no psychiatric or neurodevelopmental condition (N = 40) first passively viewed short videos of spontaneous facial expressions (anger, happiness, sadness, fear and neutral) while facial muscle responses over the Corrugator supercilii and the Zygomaticus major regions, as indicator of facial mimicry, and skin conductance, as indicator of emotional arousal, were recorded. In a separate task, the same emotional expressions were judged regarding the presented emotion category, the confidence in the accuracy of this judgment, and the intensity of the observed emotional experience. Perceived emotional intensity was more strongly linked to physiological arousal in individuals with social anxiety compared to controls for sadness displays, and less strongly linked to congruent facial muscle activations to anger displays in individuals on the autism spectrum. Differences in self-reported interoception seemed to play a role in the latter link, suggesting alterations in sensing and integrating embodied emotions in autism.","Rates of depression and anxiety among young people have been steadily increasing worldwide, with the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbating these trends. This led the US Surgeon General to declare a youth mental health crisis in December, 2021. Some research indicates that social media use has contributed to young people’s poor mental health, but reviews and meta-analyses have revealed that associations between social media use and mental health and wellbeing are weak and inconsistent at best. Thus, emotion researchers may benefit from examining psychological risk factors associated with social media use that might predispose someone to be at greater risk for developing anxiety disorders and depression in the first place. Contingent self-worth (CSW), which describes situations in which a person’s self-esteem is easily impacted—in both positive and negative ways—by various factors (e.g., others’ approval, family relationships, academic performance, etc.) may be an important, understudied risk factor. Here, we will discuss findings from an emotion regulation training study that adapted aspects of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, specifically values articulation, in order to target approval-related CSW as experienced on social media and reduce daily anxiety and depression symptoms. We also will unpack brain mechanisms that underlie training efficacy, specifically functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, which may reflect more positive self-appraisals and altered CSW rooted in self-endorsed values and thereby less susceptible to external influences (e.g., others’ approval). We will conclude with future directions and policy implications of this novel approach to emotion regulation training.","Mindfulness-based programs for adolescents have lately become popular all over the world. Research already shows that these types of interventions result in positive effects on both mental and physical health. Mindfulness practice is considered emotionally, socially and academically beneficial for adolescents delivering lasting improvement in well-being. Since number of interventions and research on it is rapidly increasing, there is a need for valid and reliable measurements of mindfulness skills in adolescents. The CAMM is a single-factor self-report measure developed to asses present-moment awareness, non-judgmental and no avoidant responses to thoughts and feelings. The present study was checking the theoretical validity of the questionnaire in the sample of Polish adolescents aged 12 to 15 years (N = 325). Correlations with measures of suppression and psychological inflexibility were calculated as well as correlations with measures of psychological well-being and general health. Similarly, to original validation study, the following tools were used: The White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI), Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire (AFQ), Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well Being (WEMBWS), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).\n Overall, results suggest that CAMM is theoretically valid in the Polish group of adolescents. Mindfulness correlated positively to well-being and negatively to thought suppression, psychological inflexibility and health problem symptoms, which suggests that mindfulness is an adaptive skill.","Disgust and pain are both unpleasant responses to stimuli that are typically threatening. Pain signals potential immediate harm and disgust signals potential threat of contamination and/or disease. Research also finds similar gender effects with men responding with lower disgust and lower pain than women. We hypothesized individual differences in both disgust and pain responses, such that disgust responsiveness (touching disgust-evoking items) would be negatively correlated with pain measures of threshold and tolerance (lower scores indicate more pain). Additionally, we tested whether a measure of emotional control (ATEE, Attitudes Toward Emotional Expression) predicted both disgust and pain responsiveness. 82 (48M,34W) participants were first tested on standard cold-pressor task, recording first vocalized pain (Threshold) and hand removal from icy water (Tolerance). Afterward, disgust ratings obtained (Mean-combined disgust ratings) for 4 disgust-evoking objects. Surprisingly, significant gender differences only found for disgust measures, not for pain. As predicted, a negative relationship between Mean-combined and mean Pain Tolerance (r=-.31, p<.004) was significant; but not for Threshold. The ATEE was significantly correlated with both Pain Threshold (r=.260, p=.019) and Tolerance (r=.320, p=.003) suggesting the more control over one’s emotions the better pain control. However, ATEE was unrelated to any disgust measure. A linear regression confirmed Mean-combined disgust (beta=-.279, p=.008) and ATEE (beta=.285, p=.007) as negative and positive predictors of mean Tolerance, respectively. Correlations among evoked disgust and pain measures suggest similar underlying psychological mechanisms. Those who reported higher disgust exhibited lower pain tolerance. Emotional control might be an important factor in pain (and disgust?) responsiveness.","Childhood engagement in the arts has been connected to improved social-emotional skills. However, connections between childhood dance engagement and a critical social-emotional skill, affective theory of mind (AToM), has not yet been studied. AToM is the ability to read and understand others’ emotions. In this study, we examine connections between childhood dance participation and AToM using a longitudinal mixed-methods study. In the quasi-experimental quantitative strand, children aged 7-12 years old in the dance group (N = 65) participated in one academic year of dance and were compared to a treated control group (N = 47) who participated in one academic year of sports. Children were assessed pre- and post- on quantitative measures of facially-cued, bodily-cued, and contextually-cued AToM. In the qualitative strand, dance teacher interviews (N = 17) and child and parent open ended responses (N = 65) were thematically coded. \n Preliminary results suggest that overall, dance training was related to better performance for bodily-cued AToM (p’s < 0.05) but not for facially-cued or contextually-cued AToM (p’s > 0.05). Qualitative emergent themes suggested that dance education can improve body-focused AToM because it provides a coached embodied practice of expressing and deciphering emotions and provides children a safe space to practice social-emotional skills. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to empirically examine the relationship between childhood dance engagement and AToM development as well as elucidate processes within dance education that might support this emotion-related skill growth. Results may inform how dance may be another avenue for childhood social-emotional intervention.","Gendered vocal expressions of fear, anger, sadness and happiness were investigated for mild to moderate Parkinson’s disease (PD). \n  Prosodic features (related to fundamental frequency (F0), intensity (I) and time domain) and acoustic correlates of voice quality (CPPS, jitter, shimmer and HNR) were collected from 14 patients with PD (mean age = 69.93; SD = 7.12; 8 males, 6 females) and 13 healthy controls (HC) (mean age = 68.13; SD= 8.27; 5 males, 8 females) matched for age, sex, and years of education. The utterances were extracted from four emotional and one neutral text. The neutral utterance and the emotional utterances were compared. Intra-sex comparison (female with PD vs female HC and male with PD vs male HC) and inter-sex comparison (female with PD vs male with PD) were performed with the Mann-Whitney test. A Mann-Whitney test was also used to compare the different emotional conditions, considering sex and diagnosis as well.\n  No significant intra-sex differences were found for the neutral speech but inter-sex differences emerged. Regarding emotional speech, females with PD featured lower MaxF0 than female HCs for happiness and higher intensity variability (SD I) for sadness. Utterances by females with PD had lower CPPS than utterances by HCs for anger and fear. Utterances by males with PD had lower minimum intensity (MinI) than utterances by male HCs when expressing fear. \n PD emotional vocal expression proved impaired and differs by sex. Such findings may have a big impact on the quality of life of patients with PD.","Emotion policing is a form of emotional injustice that occurs when efforts are made to distort the nature of the emotions that an individual or a social group is disposed to have, or the ways those emotions are expressed. It is often an attempt to establish or maintain an oppressive emotion norm, i.e., when specific people are expected to have specific emotions in specific circumstances. Emotion policing can take several forms, including Emotion Stereotyping, Emotion Display Suppression, and Emotion Hegemonizing. The talk will analyze these forms of emotional injustice, delineating their application to marginalized groups, as well as sketch possible paths to resisting these forms of oppression.","Deontic authority is the idea that one person has the ‘power’ to make decisions or bring about consequences for the other person (Lukes, 1978). Patient safety is a priority in mental health inpatient settings and as such, it is often necessary for staff to have deontic authority over the patients they care for. Indeed, a high percentage of service users on mental health wards are admitted involuntarily under the mental health act, making the deontic authority of staff explicit. \n Service users within these situations may display behaviours of agitation, frustration, distress, or conflict. Healthcare staff attempt to diffuse escalating behaviours through verbal and non-verbal communication, known as de-escalation. However, we know little about how this occurs in practice, or the impact of staff communication strategies on the outcome of these interactions. \n \n The aim of this study is to explore how staff communicate to negotiate their deontic authority during incidents of de-escalation in real world settings. We will also examine the relationship between their approaches and de-escalation success. De-escalation success has been operationalised as halting the sequence of conflict for that service user avoiding the need to use restrictive practices such as restraint (held to limit movement), seclusion (locked in isolation) and rapid tranquilisation (involuntarily injected with psychotropic medication). \n \n Methods: \n De-escalation incidents (n=46), involving a service user and one (or multiple) members of staff, on acute adult mental health wards are being recorded using body cameras worn by staff. \n Analysis\n Staff communication will be annotated in ELAN, providing a behavioural time series that can be exported for statistical analysis. A speech act coding framework, specifically developed for this context, will be applied to the transcriptions. The relationship between specific speech acts (as well as the degree of direct or indirectness) and de-escalation success will be examined.\n \n Results\n Analysis of this data is currently underway and the findings will be presented. We hope to identify patterns of staff communication that can enhance agency of service users, despite the disempowering context. \n \n References:\n Lukes, S. 1978. “Power and authority”.

Theories differ, though, in (1) the nature of the synchronization, such as causal, associative, or connectionist (Barrett, 2017; Scherer, 2019; Suri & Gross, 2022); and (2) the kind of components and features within them (e.g. evaluative criteria, lexicalized emotions). Attempts to characterize emotions with componential profiles must therefore face the sheer number of possible combinations. For instance, the GRID system (Fontaine et al., 2013) provides 142 columns-like features shared by every row representing a discrete emotion. A rectangular data representation, though, forces a profile that is difficult to fit and scale to a wide variety of emotion structures. It may thus be worth investigating the feasibility and interest for a collective, theory-agnostic, and loosely structured database of componential emotions in which entries can leverage on more flexible data structures provided by NoSQL databases. These structures present the following advantages: (1) entries don’t have to provide the same number or kind of components and features; (2) the structure can be nested, for components to be sub-organized in more fine-grained criteria, including multiple and alternative options; and (3) entries can be augmented by multi-modal features such as images, videos, or sounds. The many potential applications of the database include measures of distance/similarity between emotions, computable both from the structure and values of entries, or complex queries adopted to retrieve richer profiles from partial inputs.","Effects of emotion elicitation and regulation unfold dynamically over time. However, research usually investigates these two processes separately. Whether this approach leads to conclusive results is highly debated (cf. Kappas, 2011).\n Thus, we investigated the time course of facial muscle responses of emotion and regulation in a standard emotion regulation paradigm (e.g., Schönfelder et al., 2014) in which the information of required regulation (viewing vs. reappraisal vs. distraction) was presented first followed by the emotion (negative vs. neutral pictures).\n Facial electromyography was recorded over corrugator and zygomaticus regions. Data (N=105) were analyzed time-locked to emotion-stimulus onset. We predicted that separate processes would reveal first an emotion main effect followed by a regulation main effect. As predicted, over the corrugator region, the first emotion main effect was found at 300 ms after emotion-stimulus onset; whereas emotion regulation had only marginally significant effects at 1100 ms. Over the zygomaticus region, at 1700 ms a first significant emotion main effect was found; no other significant effects emerged.\n The results support the idea that emotion is processed first, and subsequently regulation. The absence of an interaction effect needs further investigation.","Facial expressions of pain have an adaptive function in informing others of the need of attention and care. The detection of these nonverbal cues is particularly important in children since they are not always capable of expressing their needs verbally. Nevertheless, research recurrently shows that distinguishing between genuine, suppressed, and simulated pain expressions produced by children is a difficult task for adults; even when their professions require such a skill (e.g., doctors or nurses). Only a few studies have explored the development of this specific ability amongst children’s peers. The current study aims to fill this literature gap by exploring children’s ability to recognize and judge genuine, simulated, and suppressed expressions of pain produced by other children their age. Seventy-nine children from kindergarten to fourth grade viewed videos in which children encoders expressed the three aforementioned types of pain while plunging their hand in cold or warm water. Participants were asked to select the type of pain that was expressed. They were also asked their level of confidence in their answer and the level of pain they thought the children were experiencing. Despite having a high level of confidence in their answers, kindergarteners had a significantly lower proportion of correct answers compared to children in third and fourth grade. Furthermore, regardless of their grade level, children were better at recognizing suppressed pain expressions and had lower performance rates for genuine pain recognition. Our overall findings revealed an improvement in children's performance with aging.","Links between colour and emotion are systematic and cross-culturally stable. For instance, lighter colours as more positive and darker colours as more negative. Then, yellow, pink, and most other colour categories are linked to positive emotions, while black, grey and brown are linked to negative emotions. It is thus not surprising that researchers and the public more widely assume that positive colours are liked, while negative colours are disliked. Indeed, the most prominent theory of colour preferences – the Ecological Valence Theory (EVT, Palmer & Schloss, 2010, PNAS) explained colour preferences through valence associations with coloured objects. Yet, there are inconsistencies that do not fit this proposition, most notably yellow, pink, blue and black. The former two are largely disliked but carry positive connotations, while the latter, in particular blue, are liked a lot but have some negative connotations. We question where such discrepancies between affective connotations and preferences come from. Here, I reason that colour preferences are rooted in aesthetic pleasantness while colour-emotion associations are rooted in conceptual associations. In other words, colour preferences are based on a very basic arousal/motivation system, being thus more individual, while colour-emotion associations are based on a conceptual system, which is likely shared across people. Colour is not an exception in this regard, similar discrepancies have been reported for music and odours. Overall, understanding relationships between the different types of affect (here, emotion associations and preferences) might shed light on other domains in the affective science.","Emotions have been traditionally examined in a third-person context with emotions being induced by stimuli presented from a monitor. These approaches are usually non-naturalistic in design, observing participants simultaneously viewing stimuli without them interacting with each other. Second-person approaches on the other hand, have been utilised to investigate the social interactions between individuals and whether this has an impact on social signals processing. Our research is interested in the differences in neural signal when participants interact with each other in a naturalistic way versus neural signal generated from viewing the same stimuli. We are interested in whether classification approaches such as convoluted neural networks differ when they are trained using EEG signals obtained in naturalistic interactions versus inducing them through stimuli from a monitor. We are currently recruiting participants for an EEG-hyperscanning study where participants will perform an emotion recognition paradigm to induce discrete emotions, as well as a naturalistic interaction where participants will discuss experiencing emotions with the neural signal of the listener in this interaction examined. We will then apply machine-learning classification methods to these differing data types and assess the validity and classification accuracy from either approach. The data collected will be used to develop an emotionally intelligent avatar that is more naturalistic based from this emotional classifier with improved human-agent interactions from increased empathy and trust. This research will hopefully demonstrate key differences in neural signals between naturalistic and non-naturalistic conditions and highlight how social signal processing differs between conditions.","This study delves into shared pain perception, investigating how individuals distinguish between their own pain and that of others, grounded in the theory of mind. The research posits that emotional embodiment results in similar pain perception for oneself and others, with a particular focus on the influence of perceived closeness between individuals in such processes.\n \n All participants (N = 102) underwent a pre-experimental mood assessment (PANAS-SF) and reported their relationship closeness to a friend (the \"other\" was contextualised in the study by asking participants to think of a friend) using the unidimensional relationship closeness scale (URCS). Further, each participant viewed and rated pain and neutral stimuli images (taken from the International Affective Picture System or IAPS) in a 2 x 2 [stimuli type (pain, neutral) x rating type (self, friend)] block design for the three parameters of valence (unhappy-happy continuum, 9-point Likert scale), arousal (calm-excited continuum, 9-point Likert scale), and confidence (not confident-highly confident continuum, 9-point likert scale).\n \n Results revealed no significant difference (t = -0.455, p = 0.649) for the self and other (friend) ratings for pain stimuli images given by participants, underscoring the significance of self-embodiment in estimating pain affect for others. Perceived closeness and valence differences (self valence - friend valence difference) exhibited a mild negative correlation (r = -0.25, p = 0.01), emphasizing the role of perceived closeness in pain affect processing for self and others. Furthermore, participant age and gender moderated the relationship between valence ratings for self and other (friend) ( p < 0.05). Overall, the study explores the pivotal role of embodiment and perceived closeness in shaping theory of mind regarding affect processing for pain for self and other.","Video-based online interactions have proven advantageous for collecting data on human socio-emotional interactions, allowing for effective recruitment of diverse study participants and scalability without needing specific facilities. However, the common practice of using ad hoc solutions, such as combining off-the-shelf video conferencing software with surveys and manual participant management, introduces challenges. These challenges include the cumbersome and time-consuming adjustment of methods for specific study purposes, potential privacy risks from relying on cloud-based tools, the necessity of special software installations by participants, and limited customization options.\n \n Given these challenges, we present \"openVIMO,\" a software platform for conducting video-based online interaction experiments built on open-source technologies. It can be deployed on a server under a researcher's control without relying on additional commercial third-party services. Concretely, it enables (1) the creation of web-based experiments and surveys involving video calls between participants, as well as (2) the remote monitoring of participants' progress throughout a study, including means for communication and intervention throughout a protocol. Moreover, openVIMO facilitates (3) collecting and storing survey and interaction data (incl. audio and video). Finally, the platform has been designed to (4) allow the staging of highly customized experimental protocols and to be dynamically expanded by the research community. \n \n We propose that openVIMO can contribute to studying human socio-emotional interactions at scale, addressing both existing practical limitations and contributing to responsible data collection practices. To this end, we reflect on its design rationale and development, especially highlighting experiences gained from developing a prototype for a previous large-scale online study.","Facial expressions are a universal and innate nonverbal signal that individuals use to communicate their emotional states. It is an essential aspect of social interactions as it allows for interpreting other people's experiences. Although many studies are conducted on the cultural, social, and individual determinants of emotion recognition skills, only a few focus on seniors. Moreover, most research focuses on the facial expression of basic emotions. We conducted two studies investigating how seniors recognise facial expressions of complex emotions. In study 1, we aimed to verify whether Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients of an institution in Poland (N = 46; 50% women; Mage = 73) would display higher difficulties concerning emotion recognition ability due to deficits resulting from progressing disease in comparison to the healthy elderly without mental disability (N = 46; 51% women; Mage = 72.7). We studied using the Emotional Intelligence Scale-Faces (EIS-F). The study's results indicated that patients suffering from early stages of AD performed significantly lower facial emotion recognition (t = -1.83, df = 90, p < 0.001, AD group: M = 59.50; healthy group: M = 63.8). In study 2, we wanted to assess the impact of mental ability on recognising mimic expressions of complex emotions. The participants (N = 122; 70% women; Mage = 73.5) were tested by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and EIS-F. The outcomes showed that age and education were better predictors of facial emotion recognition than mental ability, that both older men and women recognised emotions equally well, and that the best-recognised feeling was delight expressed by the woman. The worst-recognised emotion was the hostility triad represented by a man. The data would be interpreted as a polarization of biological against mental ageing, positive-negative asymmetry, and socioemotional selectivity theory.","The effect of context on basic emotion recognition is well documented. However, fewer studies have explored its effect of smile sincerity judgements. Furthermore, no study has explored the interaction between the personality traits of individuals and the judgment of Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiles, nor the interaction between context associated with the encoders and individual differences of the decoders. The goal of the present study is to observe the effect of personality traits of decoders, using the HEXACO-60 questionnaire, in the judgment of the sincerity of smiles while contexts associated with the encoder personality traits are presented. 200 participants read a paragraph related to the encoder's personality traits, either from the positive or negative pole of the trait. After judging the sincerity of Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiles on a 7-point scale, participants proceeded to complete the HEXACO questionnaire. Simple regressions and equivalence test analyses suggested that personality traits of the decoders are not significant predictors of smile judgment responses. There is also no significant relationship between the personality traits of the decoders and the personality traits of the encoders. Machine learning techniques (variable selection using random forests) showed relevant avenues regarding the influence of individual variables in the judgement of smiles, particularly for the honesty-humility and emotionality traits of the decoders. However, the type of smile and the valence of the context appeared to be the most important factors in predicting smile judgment.","The nature and generation of emotions and emotion episodes remain subjects of ongoing debate in the literature, but prevailing theories seem to suggest their multicomponent nature. This project aims to link multiple components of emotions to functional brain systems by developing and validating a novel procedure to actively elicit emotions in a naturalistic and dynamic manner. Drawing inspiration from appraisal models of emotion causation, we designed a first-person perspective, interactive videogame task to be experienced in virtual reality, which will be used to assess emotion components and brain networks. In the current iteration, we are manipulating uncertainty and expectation appraisals, influencing in-game gains and losses. \nUpon validation, the task will be integrated with fMRI to explore the effects of manipulating expectation and uncertainty appraisals on respiration, heart rate, skin conductance, and brain responses. The primary goal is to observe their impact on emotion causation, brain networks, and determine whether patterns of multicomponent responses can predict discrete emotions. We predict that different manipulations will be reflected in different elicited emotions, functional brain patterns and physiology patterns. This research aims to contribute valuable insights into the intricate interplay between emotions, their elicitation processes, and underlying neural mechanisms.","Autistic children, particularly those with average or higher IQ, often have worse school performance than expected given their cognitive abilities. Research with neurotypical children shows that, among other factors, difficulties with emotions are linked to impairments in cognitive processes, which lead to poorer school performance. Autistic children often have emotional difficulties, and these difficulties may play a role in their school performance too. In the present study, we compared 21 autistic children to 18 neurotypical children aged 6 to 14 years old, with similar IQ and socio-economic status (SES), regarding their school grades, and their parent-reported social communication skills, emotion regulation, and alexithymia. We found that compared to neurotypical children, autistic children had lower school grades, lower social communication skills, lower emotion regulation skills, and more alexithymia. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that not being autistic, having a higher SES, having lower social communication skills, and having lower alexithymia were significant predictors of higher school grades. IQ and emotion regulation skills were not significant predictors. These results suggest that some aspects of emotional ability like having low alexithymia may indeed significantly contribute to explain the school success of autistic children beyond their diagnosis, IQ, and SES. However, surprisingly, social communication skills seem to have a negative relation, with more social skills being indicative of lower school grades. Furthermore, emotion regulation skills did not contribute to predict academic success.","Introduction: The attenuation of response to repeated stimuli is termed 'habituation', and it is considered the most primitive form of learning. The goal of the study is to examine whether habituation can generalize based on semantic knowledge, to the entire category of the object. In two experiments, we asked whether affective habituation occurs for perceptual, conceptual and/or affective properties of the stimulus. Methods: Participants were repeatedly presented with an affective image, followed by a set of test images that shared perceptual, conceptual, or affective properties with the repeated stimulus. Results: habituation across different components of the emotional response (self-reported feelings, facial expressions) was generalized up to the conceptual level of the repeated stimulus for pleasant, but not for unpleasant stimuli. Conclusions: The findings of the present study are discussed in relation to disgust research by highlighting differences in habituation of pleasant and unpleasant stimuli.","The theory of constructed emotion (TCE, Barrett, 2017) describes how language can play a key role in emotion perception based on the predictive coding view. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence showing whether language influences emotion perception in terms of immediate predictive processing. To investigate the effect of emotion labels on the predictive processing of facial expressions, we used passive oddball task and visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) ERP component interpreted as prediction error (PE) signal. In study 1, participants responded to the emotion labels (“Happiness,” “Anger,” or “Shape”) as target amid repeated presentations of fixation cross. In Study 2, participants responded to target animal labels amid repeated presentations of either “Happiness,” “Anger,” or “Shape” label. In both studies, task-irrelevant standard (Study 1: happy-angry morphed face; Study 2: neutral face, about 80% of the trials) or deviant (happy or angry face, about 10% each) stimuli were presented in the background of repeated stimuli. VMMN was obtained by subtracting the ERP elicited by standard faces from that elicited by happy or angry deviant faces. The convergent results of Studies 1 and 2 showed that when emotion label and facial expression were incongruent, a greater amplitude of vMMN was evoked in occipito-temporal electrodes compared to congruent or irrelevant conditions. These results suggest the possibility that prior expectation activated by emotion labels does not significantly affect predictive processing when it matches the sensory input but increases prediction error responses when it does not match. These results suggest that prior expectation activated by emotion labels increases prediction error responses when it does not match the sensory input.","Through the Nightingale oath, nurses affirm their devotion to the wellbeing of those committed to their care. As a profession, nursing emphasizes compassion and care and with this comes taboos on anger and aggression. Hochschild was the first to identify “feeling rules” in association with particular occupational roles. The professional “feeling rules” of nursing were reinforced in the collective framing of nurses as heroes during the COVID-19 pandemic, with their stories and struggles catalogued copiously by major news outlets. The unprecedented nature of the pandemic, however, raises questions about the durability of professional feeling rules during times of crisis. Using a sample of 21 diaries from U.S. nurses during the first year of the pandemic (May 2020 – January 2021), we examine the role of feeling rules and rule-breaking among this emotionally-restricted profession during the crisis. We ask: how were feeling rules upheld, resisted, or reframed by nurses during the pandemic? We find evidence of some emotional rule-breaking in the form of rage and anger directed at diverse sources (the public, nurse managers, and hospital policies), but the majority of nurses used metaphors, references to “frustration” or “strong feelings,” or softened their anger discourse to manage these feelings in real time. We also identify feelings of disorientation, numbness, routinization to manage fear, and a range of negative and positive emotions. Diary methods are particularly well-suited to capturing the situated, dynamic, and complex nature of emotions, including taboo emotions, within a profession facing an unprecedented crisis.","According to Izard (1977) awe might be an intense variant of interest that motivates curiosity and exploration. However, recent work shows that state awe (vs. interest) is linked to a greater appreciation of present circumstances, a greater sense of smallness, and a lesser sense of exploration (Campos et al., 2013), and that it broadens attentional scope on a global-local attention processing task (Sung & Yih, 2015).\n  \n To directly compare how awe (NS1 = 56, NS2 = 67) differs from interest (NS1 = 68, NS2 = 66) and curiosity (NS1 = 68, NS2 = 61), we reanalysed data from our recent paper (in press) in which 6 emotions were manipulated through retrospective recall. While the original paper compared awe to the mean of 5 other epistemic emotions, here, using simple contrasts, we compared awe directly to interest and to curiosity.\n  \n Across both studies we found that awe (vs. interest and curiosity) was less likely to arise when the situation contained insufficient information, and was more likely to arise when the situation exceeded one’s expectancies. Awe (vs. interest and curiosity) was also linked to a greater sense of smallness, and awe was higher in positive valence when compared to curiosity, but not when compared to interest. Finally, we uncovered no significant differences for action tendencies (exploration and avoidance).","This oral presentation seeks to explain the unique methodology used in my PhD study exploring racialised emotions amongst Black students in an elite British university. In the context of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI), racial equity policies and mental health concerns within higher education, understanding the emotional experiences of racially marginalised communities within the university is imperative. This research not only adds to growing literature around these topics but also joins scholarly works around emotion and affect into the discussion. However, researching emotions from a sociological lens lacks an established methodology for best practice. Therefore I intend to discuss the varying opinions around researching emotions with a strong emphasis on Black feminist thought which has provided valuable insight into emotions experienced by racialised minorities for the purpose of this study. I will then proceed to delve into my own study exploring the different methods chosen and justifying their uses. The research methods chosen for this study are: semi-structured interviews; walking observations; creative methods; and focus groups. By drawing attention to the methodology, I seek to increase knowledge and understanding of emotion and affect that can be applied in differing sociological contexts as well as provide practical implications for promoting a stronger sense of belonging and personal well-being for Black students in higher educational environments.","Time spent alone is common in daily life, and particularly in old age; it may at times be experienced as lonely, and at times as calming (positive solitude). The use of machine learning to interpret human language (e.g., natural language processing or NLP) has been growing in psychology, and NLP has been used to distinguish experiences of loneliness from positive solitude in social media data (e.g., tweets). How effective might such NLP techniques be for classifying naturally-occurring aloneness experiences in older adults’ everyday lives? The present study uses 1,546 thought samples collected from 133 adults aged 18-85 (M = 49.6 years; 73% female) at moments when they were alone over a 1-3 week period; participants reported their current thoughts (open-ended) and affective states (lonely, calm) at each assessment. Support vector machines were then used to classify moments of aloneness as being lonely (vs. not lonely) and calm (vs. not calm) based on the words participants used when describing their thoughts. When compared against participants’ actual reported affective states, these classifications achieved up to 67% accuracy for “lonely” and 79% accuracy for “calm”. “Lonely” thought reports included the word “work” more frequently, whereas “calm” thought reports more frequently included the words “reading” and “think/thought”, suggesting individuals engage in quiet or contemplative activities during positive solitude. Age differences therein are also examined. Findings suggest that NLP may be a useful tool for identifying older adults at risk of loneliness (and its negative health implications) by using brief reports of their everyday thoughts.","The present research examines whether and how emotions promote fairness and cooperation in nested social dilemmas. These economic games (adapted from Wit & Kerr, 2002) model situations where a person’s individual interests are at odds with the interests of their group or a larger collective. In six studies, involving vignettes (N = 814) and real-time interactions between humans and avatars (N = 353), participants were led to categorize themselves as individuals, as subgroup members, or as members of a larger collective. They were then exposed to out-group individuals who displayed positive or negative emptions after resource allocation decisions that directly benefitted the out-group rather than the superordinate collective. Neither outgroup emotions nor the parochial behavior of the out-group consistently impacted participants’ own allocations to the private, group, and collective accounts. However, findings of the four vignette studies revealed that participants’ decisions were influenced by the context in which the social dilemma was presented. Specifically, people consistently allocated more resources to the larger collective in a context referring to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa than in the context of a neighborhood improvement project. These choices were strongly associated with prescriptive social norms. Together, the studies illustrate the challenges of adapting social dilemmas to realistic scenarios and highlight the importance of context in decision-making.","Creativity, one of the 21st-century key soft skills, is the ability to produce something that is both original and appropriate (e.g., Tang & Gruszka, 2017). Virtual reality (VR) offers new ways to support creativity, for example by engaging users in new experiences (Bourgeois-Bougrine et al., 2022). These can include experiencing complex emotions like awe, a mix of joy, wonder and fear (e.g., Chirico, 2020). Awe occurs when perceiving an immense and unfamiliar environment, physical or virtual as well, leading to a flexibilization of mental patterns (e.g., Chirico & Gaggioli, 2018). Not surprisingly, awe has been found to foster creativity (e.g., Chirico et al., 2018). VR also allows investigating embodied cognition, the influence of gestures on thought (Wiepke, 2023). Embodying creative metaphors such as “breaking the walls” can enhance creativity in VR (Leung et al., 2012).\n As mentioned, previous studies showed how inducing awe or including embodied metaphors, separately, affects creativity performance. In this work, we investigate whether this effect is enhanced when combining both factors. We present a VR experimental study where we manipulate (1) the environment: awe-inducing (mountains landscape) vs neutral (urban park); (2) the embodied metaphor “taking a step up”: moving like a bird (freely flying and landing along the road path), vs classic VR moves. Creativity is measured using the Alternative Use Task (Benedek et al., 2013). We hypothesize that both awe and embodied cognition positively influence the creativity performance, with awe having the strongest effect and embodied cognition acting as mediator.","Antipathy is an affective phenomenon which has not received much attention by philosophers and psychologists, unlike its antonym, sympathy. However, antipathy is a phenomenon that contributes to and fuels many of the challenges related to our social behaviours and interpersonal relationships. Antipathy’s exact nature needs to be identified, if only because of the importance it has, for example, in political opposition, in loss of civility, but also in situations that cause poor psychological well-being. It would be then essential to be able to determine whether antipathy is a phenomenon that could be felt on a short term (an episode) or last in the long term (a disposition), since it would allow to study and measure more precisely the nature of the acts it gives rise to, the range of its intensity or/and its social consequences. Like sympathy, antipathy is most often understood as an affective phenomenon that lasts over time. Antipathy is often presented as an instinctive and irrational aversion to something or someone. Yet this common definition is too similar to the definition of other affective phenomena such as disgust or even fear. This talk will therefore examine the nature of antipathy by differentiating it from other emotional phenomena that resemble it. However, while the limited existing literature on antipathy characterises it primarily as an affective disposition, I will argue that antipathy is a conscious emotion, i.e., an emotion that occurs consciously and has a phenomenology (i.e., a phenomenal character). \n The talk is organized as follows. In §1, I introduce the affective phenomenon of antipathy by contrasting it with sympathy. In §2, I clarify what an affective disposition is, what a conscious emotion is and how they relate and differ. In §3, I present the most common theory or standard theory of antipathy, the one according to which antipathy is a disposition. Then, in §4, I argue that antipathy can be defined as a conscious emotion rather than as an affective disposition. In §5, I examine an objection to the idea that antipathy could be considered as an emotion and propose a response to this objection.","Previous research on construal level theory shows that people who have a more abstract (vs concrete) thinking style tend to focus less on contextual characteristics and difficulties, making broader categorizations of situations or events. A more global categorization could facilitate perceiving outgroups as less different and then promotes perceiving less competitiveness and more positive feelings towards them. As a first step to explore these influences, the present study aimed to test how the adoption of a more abstract thinking style favors these links. In an experimental design, which used a sample of undergraduate university students (n= 99), we manipulated construal level (concrete vs. abstract thinking style) and measured perception of group competitiveness and emotions (threat, security, and positive and negative affect) towards a fictitious outgroup of migrant students described as being unfriendly but intelligent. Results showed that participants who had been primed with a more abstract thinking style (vs. concrete) perceived the outgroup as less competitive and reported feeling higher security and positive affect towards outgroup members. Given that it is possible to induce an abstract mindset through a variety of different methods, these results offer support for new strategies for interventions which aim to increase positive intergroup emotions and to improve the relationships between different groups of people.","Most creative ideas result from hard work, yet an outstanding idea can arise spontaneously from an insight. This sudden experience of a solution to a given open problem is also called an “aha” experience or Eureka moment. Previous research highlighted that a self-reported emotional reaction and increased skin conduction response follow an insight. Nevertheless, it is still uncertain whether an emotional response is a consequence or a signaling and preceding mechanism of an insight. As a result, our curiosity was sparked by determining if a specific physiological response, which might signal an emotional state, precedes the behavioral response (i.e., the solution), enabling us to differentiate between solutions with and without insight. During the piloting phase, 19 participants engaged in a remote association task where they had to answer 72 items. These items were separated into three blocks, each including 24 items. After a button press (signaling the moment of a solution), participants provided their solution and had to decide whether they had an insight. We further asked for confidence in their response and emotional state at the moment of the idea. During the experiment, physiological parameters, such as heart rate variability and skin conductance, were recorded. Using multi-level modeling, we compared correct solutions with and without insights and no response conditions. Based on the first preliminary findings of this study presented in Triste, Marconi Institute for Creativity, 2023, we present follow-up results investigating the spontaneous phenomenon of insight and its physiological and emotional antecedents.","Active listening is a crucial component of therapeutic interventions, creating social cohesion and trust between individuals to enhance the therapeutic relationship (Hutchby, 2005). This social cohesion is often referred to as dyadic synchrony and refers to the cooperation and reciprocal assurance between a dyad (Lei & Gratch, 2023). Synchrony often facilitates dialogic interaction by enforcing the dynamic between the speaker and listener through various behavioural and non-verbal cues for the exhibition of empathy (Lei & Gratch, 2023; Spencer & McKeown, 2020). Active listening includes phatic communication, verbal confirmation of concentration such as \"uh-huh,\" as well as reflecting and rephrasing the speaker's stream of consciousness back to them (Simon, 2018). Key non-verbal features of engagement are head nods and smiles. Here, we use therapeutic stimuli from recordings of online sessions from three different therapists that are available on the internet. We use affective computing software to measure the intensity, frequency, and depth of pitch of head nods and the intensity of FACS action units 12 and 6 during smile episodes. This has generated 120 thin-slice video clips of head nods, smiles, and a control group with no obvious social signals: forty clips each. These interactions are rated using measures of rapport and empathy in a pre-registered study. Ratings are continuous scales of empathy and rapport, with additional scales adapted from the empathy subscale of the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory and a rapport scale (Gratch et al., 2015).","Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is a severe mental health issue that has doubled since the pandemic, affecting 20% of adolescents. Despite the availability of treatments, many socially anxious adolescents avoid therapy due to the fear of social exposure and negative evaluations, resulting in undertreatment. To address this issue, our study aims to deliver evidence-based therapies through digital interventions, which are cost-effective and non-threatening. In our proof-of-concept study, we developed digital variations of the detached mindfulness intervention, known to target metacognition, and the slow breathing intervention, known to target heart rate variability, and proved their effectiveness in alleviating their targeted mechanisms in a healthy student sample. In the current study, we will assess the effectiveness of these interventions in highly socially anxious youth during a socially stressful public speaking task. Adolescents (N = 270) will be randomly allocated to either the slow breathing intervention, detached mindfulness intervention, or their matched active controls. Participants will first receive a 10-minute digital intervention training, immediately followed by a public speaking test. We will measure state anxiety, negative metacognitive beliefs, and heart rate variability throughout the experiment. Additionally, we will assess participants' subjective performance ratings to understand which aspects of public speaking tasks the intervention can target. The project is currently ongoing and will be completed in June. Therefore, I will present the full results, combined with the proof-of-concept findings, during the conference.","Objectives : In psychodynamic literature, it has been proposed that chronic pain problems with no physiological causes may function as expiatory punishment for individual's guilt feelings. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of guilt feelings on formation of nocebo pain and whether the resultant nocebo pain would alleviate guilt feelings as expiatory punishment. Materials and Methods : 100 subjects participated in the experiment. Two independent variables of the experiment were guilt induction (guilt-no guilt) and nocebo manipulation (nocebo-no nocebo). Nocebo manipulation to induce headache was executed by telling the participants that they would receive mild electricity via an EEG cap. In addition, they watched a video in which a confederate imitates having pain during the experimental procedure. Two dependent variables of the experiment were guilt feelings and experienced pain. Guilt feelings were measured with Positive and Negative Affect Scale twice, once after guilt induction and once after nocebo pain manipulation. Experienced subjective pain scores were measured via a basic 0 to 10 visual pain scale. Results : The results showed that only the main effect of nocebo pain manipulation was significant. Conclusions: In a standard laboratory environment, the participants reported mild headaches in absence of any physical nocebo stimulation. Non-physical nocebo pain induction may conceive pain but guilt feelings did not incite the amount of reported nocebo pain and resultant pain did not alleviated guilt feelings.","The job interview domain is a complex and interactive setting where job applicants seek to present themselves as having desirable competencies and characteristics. Thus, many job applicants strategically manage their behaviors (impression management) in front of interviewers. Interviewers, on their side, can also be subject to biases when assessing job applicants. One possible source of bias is the interviewer’s mood state, which can influence their perception of applicants and hence their ensuing hiring or salary decisions. As of yet, researchers have not examined how the interaction between applicants’ impression management behaviors and interviewers’ mood impacts selection decisions. Therefore, I propose a 2 x 2 between-subject experimental design, manipulating job applicants' impression management behavior (self-/other-focused) and interviewers’ (the participants’) mood (pleasant/unpleasant). I will randomly assign participants to watch a pleasant or unpleasant video, manipulating their mood. Subsequently, I will present participants with a job description and application materials for a job applicant. Furthermore, I will randomly assign participants to listen to a prerecorded audio clip of a structured interview manipulated to contain self- or other-focused impression management behaviors. Finally, I will ask participants for their perceptions of the applicant and to provide hiring and salary decisions regarding the applicant. \n Given the substantial costs associated with talent acquisition and the potential for concealed biases in selecting job applicants, this research can make meaningful contributions toward minimizing organizational selection errors and may offer valuable insights for both research and practice. Data will be collected, analyzed, and ready to present by the conference date.","Popularity is key to influencers' career success. In four studies (total N=997), we show that influencers successfully navigating multiple demands on their emotional behavior by expressing authentic and appropriate are more likely to gain popularity.","This paper presents an in-depth analysis of gamification in digital applications, drawing from the ancient Greek philosophies of Plato and Aristotle. With the prevalence of gamification across various sectors, its ethical and societal implications warrant critical examination. Our research bridges classical philosophical insights with contemporary digital phenomena, offering a unique perspective on the ethical dimensions of gamification. Plato's allegory of the cave and theory of forms are employed to explore the perception and value of virtual realities and achievements in gamified environments. This Platonic lens raises questions about the authenticity of gamified experiences and the potential risks of users mistaking virtual accomplishments for real-world fulfillment. Aristotle’s virtue ethics, focusing on moderation, virtue, and eudaimonia, provides a framework for assessing the impact of gamification on user behavior. The Aristotelian perspective scrutinizes how gamification may influence ethical decision-making and the development of moral virtues. This work also delves into specific gamification elements such as the hero's journey narrative, altruistic actions, badge levels, and user autonomy, examining their ethical implications through these ancient philosophical doctrines. Additionally, the ethical responsibilities of gamification designers are discussed, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing user well-being and ethical development over commercial objectives. This study not only contributes to a deeper understanding of the ethical implications of gamification but also highlights the need for responsible design practices in digital applications, opening avenues for further research, including cross-cultural philosophical analyses, empirical studies on the impact of gamification, and the exploration of ethical guidelines for gamification design in light of technological advancements.","In recent years, social signal processing techniques using multimodal information have been used in interview training systems [1-4]. Several studies have shown that practicing interviews with a virtual agent as an interviewer is more effective in improving interviewees’ performance than with human interviewers [5-7] and reduces interview anxiety [8]. However, these studies focused on the presence of a virtual agents and not on the communication methods agents use during interviews.\n Our proposed system recognizes the nonverbal behaviors of an interviewee, namely, gaze, facial expression, and posture [9-11]. A virtual agent acted as an advisor gives feedback on the interviewee’s behaviors that need improvement. We focus on assertive communication and implemented it as a communication method for virtual agents [12]. Assertive communication is a method of expressing one's opinions and feelings while respecting another’s position and has been used in corporate training [13].\n We examine the effectiveness of assertive feedback in terms of usefulness of the feedback, and interpersonal impressions of the agent. Whether the feedback is useful or threatening depends on the individual characteristics. Therefore, the learning-from-failure tendency [14], in which interviewees try to learn and grow from their failures rather than perceiving failures as threats, may influence the effectiveness of assertive feedback.\n The results indicated that assertive feedback showed higher effectiveness in emotional aspect by reducing the agent’s aggressiveness for those with a low tendency to learn from failures and by improving the agent’s perceived friendliness for those with a high tendency to learn from failures.\n (247 words)\n (list of references are omitted from the abstracts)","Recent research has found that Americans are disgusted by anonymous members of their political outgroup. Determining whether the disgust elicited by political outgroup members is more physical or moral may contribute to the understating of what enables its elicitation and regulation. Building on research showing the experience of moral disgust involves relatively abstract construal and the experience of physical disgust involves relatively concrete construal, we predicted that disgust experienced toward political outgroup members is more moral than physical. Two preregistered experiments (total N = 854) found that (a) the effect of level of construal on the intensity of disgust from political outgroup members is more similar to the effect of level of construal on moral disgust than on physical disgust, and (b) the appraisal underlying disgust from political outgroup members involves more abstract than concrete construal, similar to moral disgust. We discuss implications of these findings for intergroup relations and emotion regulation.","Facial expressions are an integral part of interpersonal communication. Facial expressions can display our internal states, change in response to the actions of others and influence others’ perceptions and behavioural tendencies. Therefore, facial expressivity has the potential to impacts first impressions and friendship formation. The current study explored the influence of facial expressivity and the understanding of display rules of emotions in the formation of first impressions and interpersonal connections in an informal, online group setting. Participants (N = 256) met in groups of three or four to test the hypotheses that a) more expressive individuals form better first impressions (in terms of likability, trust, and other interpersonal characteristics); b) more expressive individuals have bigger and denser social networks; and c) individuals with shared understandings of display rules of emotions are perceived more favourably by others. The results suggest that more expressive individuals are more liked, trusted and overall, perceived more favourably, by their interaction partners (a). We further discuss the outcomes of hypotheses b and c with relation to implications for how individuals engage with personal and professional social interactions in both online and face-to-face settings.","Greater facial expressivity has been linked to increased social cohesion, but the physiological mechanisms underlying this relationship have not been explored. Oxytocin is known to play a fundamental role in social interaction, particularly in terms of enhancing engagement with others. Levels of oxytocin are related to both the ability to recognise facial emotions in others and the salience of posed facial expressions; however, whether oxytocin is related to facial expressivity during real-world social interaction is largely unknown. Cortisol appears to be linked to variation in facial muscle activity, and, to a smaller extent, heightened facial emotional processing, thus highlighting a potential interplay between oxytocin, cortisol, and the regulation of facial and prosocial behaviour. Here, we will present preliminary findings on the relationship between oxytocin, cortisol, and facial expressivity (production) during social interaction. Salivary cortisol and oxytocin will be measured before and after participants engage in a social interaction between pairs of friends and pairs of strangers. Our findings will provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms underpinning social interaction, and the relationship between facial expressivity, social cohesion, and the levels of cortisol and oxytocin in the self and others.","What strategies do individuals employ to regulate anger, disgust, fear and sadness? How does the use of different strategies vary based on the type of emotion experienced? The use of six emotion regulation strategies (Distraction, Rumination, Reappraisal, Expressive Suppression, Expressive Engagement, Arousal Control) is analysed in relation to four emotions. One hundred and thirteen participants (Males = 41.6%; 44.6% of participants were aged between 20 and 29) were involved in this study. Guided by a concise description of the above mentioned six emotion regulation strategies, participants were asked to rate the extent to which they used each strategy when feeling angry, scared, sad or disgusted. A repeated measures ANOVA was run. Overall, participants were most likely to employ Rumination, whereas Arousal Control emerged as one of the least frequently utilized strategies for regulating anger, fear, sadness, and disgust. The ANOVA results unveiled significant differences in the use of the six strategies depending on the emotion experienced (except for fear). Participants exhibited significantly higher usage of Rumination compared to other strategies when feeling anger and sadness. When experiencing feelings of disgust, Expressive Engagement and Distraction were among the most used emotion regulation strategies, whereas Reappraisal was among the least frequently used. Expressive Suppression was significantly less utilised when feeling anger, and Arousal Control showed reduced usage during experiences of sadness. Collectively, among the four emotions, disgust emerged as the least regulated emotion. Results will be discussed according to the literature.","For most people, colors carry affective meanings. People also know which colors they like and dislike. The Ecological Valence Theory (EVT) was introduced to explain the origin of color preferences (Palmer & Schloss, 2010, PNAS). According to this theory, former affective experiences with colored objects shape preferences for these colors. Thus, people like blue because they think of a clear holiday sky and dislike brown because it reminds them of rotten foods. Most previous studies tested monochromatic objects (disregarding multicolored objects or abstract ideas) and used a limited range of pre-selected colors. Since its introduction, the EVT has been confirmed to be theoretically and empirically powerful. We further tested assumptions of the EVT by considering more diverse associations. We asked 135 participants (50 men) to select their favorite and least favorite colors (each time up to five) using a computerized color picker. Then, they provided free associations with each selected color. We coded these associations into nine semantic themes and analyzed their semantic meanings. In particular, we assessed whether participants associated concrete objects or abstract concepts with their chosen colors. Our results showed a large variability in free associations beyond monochromatic objects, mainly falling into Scenery, Sensory and Affective Experiences, and Abstract Concepts themes. We also obtained valence ratings of the reported associations in a new group of participants (N = 233) and will test whether positive experiences underly favorite colors and vice versa. Overall, such studies are crucial to go from descriptive to predictive models of color preferences.","Several studies have shown that early school interventions promote children’s development of social and emotional competences. Promoting Mental Health at School (Promehs) is a European, school-based mental health program focused on enhancing social and emotional learning (SEL), a psychological construct made up of five key components which include several skills such as the awareness of the emotions, the ability to manage emotions, perspective taking, and the disposition to show empathy towards others. In the present study, we implemented the Promehs program with female and male preschoolers to innovatively evaluate its effectiveness through a battery of direct evidence instead of questionnaires filled out by adults. Participants were 152 4- and 5-year-olds recruited at school in Northern Italy and randomly assigned to either an experimental group (Promehs intervention) or a control group (no intervention). All children, before and after the intervention phase, were administered validated measures of social, emotional, and cognitive abilities, including emotion understanding and theory-of-mind tasks. A repeated-measures Anova was performed showing significant Time x Group interaction since the experimental group outperformed the control group on emotion and cognitive measures of SEL (p<.001).

We used heartrate variability (HRV) as a measure of physiological arousal throughout the reading paradigm. We found that emotionally transporting oneself into a story produced greater levels of personal distress, allowing for individuals to see themselves in the place of the story’s characters. There were increases in sympathetic activation dependent on both prior levels of empathy and state-levels while reading. Results of the study suggest empathy provides a mechanism for individuals to connect to others on a cognitive, affective, and even behavioral level. To empathize with someone is to understand their perspective and to experience another’s emotions. Narrative transportation is a combination of attention, imagery, and feelings, in which an individual becomes immersed in a narrative world, influencing beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors towards others. Transportation into a narrative is an effective way to establish and even stimulate feelings of empathy and emotional connection. This provides us with opportunities to develop curricula or interventions that foster empathetic responses. If empathy can be taught, then methods can be established that effectively reduce feelings of hatred or bias towards others. Individuals who are more transported are more likely to adopt beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that are adapted to fit the narrative. By providing individuals with the opportunity to change or adapt their feelings, society can move forward, reducing negative attitudes towards others and creating a more balanced environment with acceptance and empathy."]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["Hookup culture's middle ground of \"undefined\" romantic relationships (talking to, hanging out, hooking up, etc.) offers an agentic realm for the study of emotion signals as predictors of relational change.

The models predict increased recall of emotionally negative information as well as the specific dynamics of the recall output. Here we test whether these predictions are confirmed for real-world stimuli with emotional significance. A sample of participants who reported that the war in Ukraine was personally relevant to them were asked to view sets of very negative and less negative photographs of the war, all taken from Instagram accounts of European correspondents, and then described what they recalled from these images. The data confirmed two key predictions of the models: participants recalled those photographs studied closer in time to each other contiguously, and they recalled more of the very negative photographs. However, in contradiction to the prediction of the models, participants did not recall those more negative images contiguously. Follow-up work explored the reasons this effect was not observed by differentiating between the global, visual, emotional and semantic similarity of images to understand the underlying reasons for clustering in recall of complex novel scenes.

University students completed self-report measures of alexithymia, SPS, and fantasizing. In Study 1 (N = 700) we identified two clusters of SPS traits: a positive facet (sensitivity to subtle sensory cues) and a negative facet (sensitivity to uncomfortable sensations). In the 499 participants who completed the fantasy measure, we found that those who turned their attention inward (low EOT) reported stronger SPS positive traits and that this predicted a stronger tendency to imagine how fictional characters feel. In Study 2 (N = 600), we showed that the link between EOT and this tendency was mediated by emotional reactivity and fantasy proneness. We suggest that having an impoverished fantasy life mainly characterizes alexithymic individuals who score high on EOT. We argue that alexithymic individuals who score relatively low on EOT and are highly sensitive to subtle stimuli (including internally generated mental images) display fantasy proneness and develop a cognitive style characterized by using imagery-based strategies for reasoning and problem solving.

Additionally, we tested whether a measure of emotional control (ATEE, Attitudes Toward Emotional Expression) predicted both disgust and pain responsiveness. 82 (48M,34W) participants were first tested on standard cold-pressor task, recording first vocalized pain (Threshold) and hand removal from icy water (Tolerance).

Virtual reality (VR) offers new ways to support creativity, for example by engaging users in new experiences (Bourgeois-Bougrine et al., 2022). These can include experiencing complex emotions like awe, a mix of joy, wonder and fear (e.g., Chirico, 2020). Awe occurs when perceiving an immense and unfamiliar environment, physical or virtual as well, leading to a flexibilization of mental patterns (e.g., Chirico & Gaggioli, 2018). Not surprisingly, awe has been found to foster creativity (e.g., Chirico et al., 2018). VR also allows investigating embodied cognition, the influence of gestures on thought (Wiepke, 2023). Embodying creative metaphors such as “breaking the walls” can enhance creativity in VR (Leung et al., 2012).\n As mentioned, previous studies showed how inducing awe or including embodied metaphors, separately, affects creativity performance. In this work, we investigate whether this effect is enhanced when combining both factors. We present a VR experimental study where we manipulate (1) the environment: awe-inducing (mountains landscape) vs neutral (urban park); (2) the embodied metaphor “taking a step up”: moving like a bird (freely flying and landing along the road path), vs classic VR moves. Creativity is measured using the Alternative Use Task (Benedek et al., 2013).

However, antipathy is a phenomenon that contributes to and fuels many of the challenges related to our social behaviours and interpersonal relationships. Antipathy’s exact nature needs to be identified, if only because of the importance it has, for example, in political opposition, in loss of civility, but also in situations that cause poor psychological well-being. It would be then essential to be able to determine whether antipathy is a phenomenon that could be felt on a short term (an episode) or last in the long term (a disposition), since it would allow to study and measure more precisely the nature of the acts it gives rise to, the range of its intensity or/and its social consequences. Like sympathy, antipathy is most often understood as an affective phenomenon that lasts over time. Antipathy is often presented as an instinctive and irrational aversion to something or someone. Yet this common definition is too similar to the definition of other affective phenomena such as disgust or even fear. This talk will therefore examine the nature of antipathy by differentiating it from other emotional phenomena that resemble it. However, while the limited existing literature on antipathy characterises it primarily as an affective disposition, I will argue that antipathy is a conscious emotion, i.e., an emotion that occurs consciously and has a phenomenology (i.e., a phenomenal character). \n The talk is organized as follows. In §1, I introduce the affective phenomenon of antipathy by contrasting it with sympathy. In §2, I clarify what an affective disposition is, what a conscious emotion is and how they relate and differ. In §3, I present the most common theory or standard theory of antipathy, the one according to which antipathy is a disposition. Then, in §4, I argue that antipathy can be defined as a conscious emotion rather than as an affective disposition. In §5, I examine an objection to the idea that antipathy could be considered as an emotion and propose a response to this objection."]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["Previous research on construal level theory shows that people who have a more abstract (vs concrete) thinking style tend to focus less on contextual characteristics and difficulties, making broader categorizations of situations or events.

As a first step to explore these influences, the present study aimed to test how the adoption of a more abstract thinking style favors these links. In an experimental design, which used a sample of undergraduate university students (n= 99), we manipulated construal level (concrete vs. abstract thinking style) and measured perception of group competitiveness and emotions (threat, security, and positive and negative affect) towards a fictitious outgroup of migrant students described as being unfriendly but intelligent. Results showed that participants who had been primed with a more abstract thinking style (vs. concrete) perceived the outgroup as less competitive and reported feeling higher security and positive affect towards outgroup members.

Nevertheless, it is still uncertain whether an emotional response is a consequence or a signaling and preceding mechanism of an insight. As a result, our curiosity was sparked by determining if a specific physiological response, which might signal an emotional state, precedes the behavioral response (i.e., the solution), enabling us to differentiate between solutions with and without insight.

This social cohesion is often referred to as dyadic synchrony and refers to the cooperation and reciprocal assurance between a dyad (Lei & Gratch, 2023). Synchrony often facilitates dialogic interaction by enforcing the dynamic between the speaker and listener through various behavioural and non-verbal cues for the exhibition of empathy (Lei & Gratch, 2023; Spencer & McKeown, 2020). Active listening includes phatic communication, verbal confirmation of concentration such as \"uh-huh,\" as well as reflecting and rephrasing the speaker's stream of consciousness back to them (Simon, 2018). Key non-verbal features of engagement are head nods and smiles. Here, we use therapeutic stimuli from recordings of online sessions from three different therapists that are available on the internet. We use affective computing software to measure the intensity, frequency, and depth of pitch of head nods and the intensity of FACS action units 12 and 6 during smile episodes. This has generated 120 thin-slice video clips of head nods, smiles, and a control group with no obvious social signals: forty clips each.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of guilt feelings on formation of nocebo pain and whether the resultant nocebo pain would alleviate guilt feelings as expiatory punishment. Materials and Methods : 100 subjects participated in the experiment. Two independent variables of the experiment were guilt induction (guilt-no guilt) and nocebo manipulation (nocebo-no nocebo). Nocebo manipulation to induce headache was executed by telling the participants that they would receive mild electricity via an EEG cap. In addition, they watched a video in which a confederate imitates having pain during the experimental procedure. Two dependent variables of the experiment were guilt feelings and experienced pain. Guilt feelings were measured with Positive and Negative Affect Scale twice, once after guilt induction and once after nocebo pain manipulation. Experienced subjective pain scores were measured via a basic 0 to 10 visual pain scale. Results : The results showed that only the main effect of nocebo pain manipulation was significant. Conclusions: In a standard laboratory environment, the participants reported mild headaches in absence of any physical nocebo stimulation.

With the prevalence of gamification across various sectors, its ethical and societal implications warrant critical examination. Our research bridges classical philosophical insights with contemporary digital phenomena, offering a unique perspective on the ethical dimensions of gamification. Plato's allegory of the cave and theory of forms are employed to explore the perception and value of virtual realities and achievements in gamified environments. This Platonic lens raises questions about the authenticity of gamified experiences and the potential risks of users mistaking virtual accomplishments for real-world fulfillment. Aristotle’s virtue ethics, focusing on moderation, virtue, and eudaimonia, provides a framework for assessing the impact of gamification on user behavior. The Aristotelian perspective scrutinizes how gamification may influence ethical decision-making and the development of moral virtues. This work also delves into specific gamification elements such as the hero's journey narrative, altruistic actions, badge levels, and user autonomy, examining their ethical implications through these ancient philosophical doctrines. Additionally, the ethical responsibilities of gamification designers are discussed, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing user well-being and ethical development over commercial objectives. This study not only contributes to a deeper understanding of the ethical implications of gamification but also highlights the need for responsible design practices in digital applications, opening avenues for further research, including cross-cultural philosophical analyses, empirical studies on the impact of gamification, and the exploration of ethical guidelines for gamification design in light of technological advancements."]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"p","attribs":{},"children":["In recent years, social signal processing techniques using multimodal information have been used in interview training systems [1-4].

Thus, people like blue because they think of a clear holiday sky and dislike brown because it reminds them of rotten foods. Most previous studies tested monochromatic objects (disregarding multicolored objects or abstract ideas) and used a limited range of pre-selected colors.
