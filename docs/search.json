While we mourn the tragedy, in Belfast we also celebrate the engineering triumph and the industry that created it. In Belfast we joke: “It was fine when it left us.”\nThe ISRE 2024 Banquet will take place in the Titanic Suite located on the top floors of Titanic Belfast with views of the Slipways and Belfast Lough, where the world famous liner was designed, built and launched. The decor in the Titanic Suites is themed on the interiors of Titanic and features a stunning replica of the liner’s famous Grand Staircase."
