    "text": "A growing body of research indicates that social media use may be contributing to young people‚Äôs poor mental health around the world. However, given the ubiquity of social media apps and their extensive integration into daily life, it is not viable to ask a young person to completely abstain from social media. Rather, a more pragmatic approach is to examine psychological risk factors associated with social media use that might predispose some individuals to be at greater risk for experiencing poor mental health in the first place.\nThis pre-conference will focus on the experience and regulation of emotions in online contexts (including social media apps) and attendant effects on mental health and wellbeing among youth and young adults. Specifically, the first talk will highlight links between use of screen media (overall) and social media (in particular), emotion regulation abilities, and wellbeing. The second talk will discuss neural correlates of emotion regulation, as measured by EEG, and links to adolescents‚Äô preference for online (versus in-person) social interactions and social anxiety symptoms. The third talk demonstrates how machine learning methods can be applied to people‚Äôs music preferences on Spotify to establish digital ‚Äútraces‚Äù of risk factors for depression and aid in early detection and prevention efforts for depression and other conditions. Collectively, the findings featured in this pre-conference represent a promising and timely new avenue for the study of emotion regulation and the field of affective science more broadly.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned talks, the pre-conference will also feature a series of data blitz presentations by trainees and early career researchers and two keynote talks about the state of the field and implications for public policy and advocacy work. The event will conclude with a panel-style Q&A and to promote further discussion, professional networking, and potential research collaborations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Emotions are inherently social, in that they are heavily influenced by interactions with others. Most of the time, they arise, evolve, and are managed in the company of and by others, whose emotions, in turn, become impacted by us as well. Fortunately, there is a growing awareness of how intertwined emotions and interpersonal relationships are, and research on this topic is rapidly increasing. In light of this evolution, this pre-conference focusses on emotions in the context of interpersonal relationships, with a particular emphasis on its dynamic nature. It will feature a series of talks presenting cutting-edge research. Keynotes and flash talks will span across multiple domains, including a wide spectrum of emotions and interpersonal relationships, such as parent-child interactions, romantic relationships and leader-member exchanges. Keynote speakers (see below) are invited experts from different fields, ranging from broader social psychology to clinical and family science. Additionally, there will be a debate about the current state and future of the field, and we are honored to announce that prof. dr. Agneta Fischer will conclude this exciting day as a discussant.\nThrough this program, we aim to exchange knowledge on the intricate ways in which emotions shape and are shaped by interpersonal relationships, and to identify key research gaps in this rapidly expanding field. Our goal is to bring together researchers from all stages and disciplines, fostering connection and interdisciplinary collaboration over this important topic.\nWe will be accepting abstract submissions for flash talk presentations (5-minute talks with 5 minutes for Q&A). Presentations should address the topic of emotions in the context of interpersonal relationships, preferably assessing research questions in a dynamic way. The abstract can be a maximum of 500 words and should outline the goals of the research, the methods used, and a summary of the results. Acceptance as a flash talk will be decided after review by the organizers, based on the fit with the main theme and with other talks."

She studies topics related to the spectrum of connections we have with others, from loneliness and secrecy to successful interpersonal emotion regulation and shared identity. In her talk, Katie will discuss emotion goals for experience and expression as a lens for understanding this range of social experiences.\nDr.¬†Reuma Gadassi-Polack (Tel Aviv-Yaffo Academic College & Yale University) examines the interpersonal and neurobiological basis of typical and atypical emotion regulation, with a special focus on depression development. Her current research deals with emotional reactions to social feedback from parents and peers during the transition to adolescence and the potential protective roles of emotion regulation and social interpretation flexibility. Dr.¬†Gadassi-Polack will talk about how coming from the background of studying emotions in romantic relationships influenced her research on emotions in the parent-adolescent relationship.\nDr.¬†Tammy English (Washington University in St.¬†Louis) conducts research on emotion and emotion regulation across adulthood from an interpersonal perspective. She studies the ways that social context and socially-oriented motives impact how emotions are managed in daily interactions, as well as the interrelationship between emotion regulation and social functioning. In her talk, Tammy will focus on emotion regulation in romantic relationships and novel ways to capture the dynamic interplay between partners that impact well-being.\ndiscussant: Prof.¬†Dr.¬†Agneta Fischer is Professor in Emotions and Affective Processes at the University of Amsterdam. Her broad research interest is emotions in social contexts, and she has published in the domain of facial expressions of emotion, emotional mimicry, culture and gender differences in emotions, social emotion regulation and the social functions of emotions. She will be the discussant in the symposium."

Our present ‚Äúage of affectism‚Äù exposes that script as both inaccurate and counterproductive. But what lies beyond it? In this talk, Professor Maroney will present an overview of her multi-year, mixed-methods empirical study into the role of emotion and its regulation in the lives and work of judges in the United States, giving us an early view of portions of her forthcoming book, What Judges Feel: How Emotions Shape Justice.\n\n\nTerry Maroney investigates the intersection of law and emotion. She is also a scholar of criminal law, with specializations in wrongful convictions and in juvenile justice. Professor Maroney‚Äôs work on the role of emotion in judicial behavior and decision-making forms the backbone of her scholarly focus. Weaving legal analysis together with the psychology, sociology and philosophy of emotion, her work illuminates how emotional experiences, dynamics, and their management interact with the constraints and demands of varied judicial roles, with deep implications for judges and the public they serve.

She frequently consults with and presents to judicial audiences in both the United States and abroad. With Judge Jeremy Fogel (now retired) and the Federal Judicial Center, she co-founded a novel intensive seminar focused on the human side of judging, now offered regularly to mid-career federal judges.\nBefore becoming a law professor, Maroney was a litigator with WilmerHale and a Skadden Fellow at the Urban Justice Center, both in New York City; she draws on that practice experience‚Äîwhich included a high-profile triple exoneration, U.S. Supreme Court advocacy, and direct representation of children‚Äîin her teaching and writing. A 1998 summa cum laude graduate of New York University School of Law, Maroney clerked for Judge Amalya L. Kearse on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, has held academic fellowships at the law schools of NYU and the University of Southern California, and from 2016-17 was the Andrew W.

This iconic building, recognised the world over, is often referred to locally as the ‚ÄúHouse on the Hill‚Äù. Opened in 1932 by the then Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VIII, Parliament Buildings is the home of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The beauty of the Building‚Äôs exterior is matched by its equally stunning interior.\nThe Great Hall, where our reception will take place, is made almost entirely from Italian Travertine, and the rich and vibrantly painted ceiling features five stunning chandeliers. The central chandelier was given to Parliament Buildings by Windsor Castle on long-term loan in 1932. This eminent venue has hosted presidents, prime ministers, popstars and royalty, but there can surely be none as illustrious as our friends in ISRE.\nDo join us on what is sure to be a conference to remember, connect with your emotion colleagues, and immerse yourself in the beauty, grandeur and history of Parliament Buildings."

For submitted contributions, we will be accepting extended abstract submissions for Poster and Flash Talk presentations (instructions below). This year‚Äôs focus is ‚ÄúOpportunities, challenges, and impacts of computational methods in emotion research‚Äù.\nThis year, we are also organizing a special session on research using Large Language Models and affective science, across the range of basic and applied research questions, for example: how well do these models understand emotions; what can we learn from the nature/representation of emotions in these models; how can we use these models to generate artificial stimuli, or label data; how can we use these models in applied systems (e.g., for emotional well-being)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Emotional development is a topic that lends itself to study at several levels of analysis and in terms of many interacting influences, and merits consideration of both individual and group differences. While research examining emotional development has traditionally been interspersed throughout ISRE meetings, the Emotional Development Preconference provides an opportunity to integrate these diverse perspectives. This event has been part of the past two ISRE meetings, at each well-attended by researchers from various theoretical, methodological, cultural, and institutional backgrounds. The results have consistently been a program that generated cross-disciplinary interaction and discussion.\nThe present pre-conference seeks to build upon this momentum through a collection of invited speakers who examine emotional development through multiple lenses. In keeping with the ethos of ISRE, the proposed pre-conference will bring together people from different countries and disciplines to focus on a central theme: Language and Emotional Development.\nKnowledge about, experiences of, and competencies for emotion change as individuals develop over the lifespan and as cultures evolve over historical time. How does the language used for emotion track these changes? What role might it play in maintaining or even precipitating them? Six invited speakers from a broad range of disciplines and stances will engage with these questions, among others, as they present research on language and emotional development. Focusing on individual development, their talks will explore how emotion words and caregiver interactions may scaffold emotion knowledge and experience in infants and young children, how fostering social and emotional skills may promote healthy behavioural and relational dynamics, and how these processes are shaped by cultural context. Focusing on cultural development, speakers will examine how words for emotion take on new meanings, how cross-cultural contact may impact language for emotion, and how these processes may subsequently influence development at the individual level. A discussant will conclude the program by considering how the confluence of these person- and culture-level approaches might tackle outstanding questions and tensions about the role of language in emotional development. The audience will have the opportunity to hear from, and interact with, a diverse array of experts and perspectives on emotional development, stimulating discussion and collaboration across disciplines and frameworks.\nAs at past Emotional Development Preconferences, submissions for flash talks and poster presentations are also solicited to encourage researchers of multiple disciplines and career stages to attend and present their research. All submissions will be evaluated by at least 2 experts of emotional development, and flash talk submissions not accepted will be considered for poster presentations. The preconference will also feature a ‚ÄúBest Poster Award‚Äù to the top presented poster, as evaluated by the invited speakers. Additionally, the program will include planned breaks for coffee/refreshments to allow attendees to discuss the presentations, form possible collaborations, and network with one another."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Whether through news, art, social media, or even in professional settings or walking on the street, people can be confronted with the suffering of others. Although other people‚Äôs suffering can evoke strong emotions (e.g., fear, outrage, sadness), people do not seem to consistently avoid such content. Engaging with the suffering of other people involves different psychological and affective processes. Through this preconference we aim to bring together scholars from different disciplines (i.e., social psychology, media psychology, criminology, neuroscience) to discuss how their research can help understand when people do, and do not, engage with a suffering other. How do people derive meaning from other people‚Äôs stories of suffering? Why do people seek out information that can evoke intense emotional reactions? When do people choose to experience empathy and when (and how) do they choose to regulate empathy? How do people respond to violent street incidents? Research on eudaimonia, empathy, curiosity and prosociality, will shed light on the affective processes, motives and outcomes of engaging with the suffering of others.\nOur goal is to bring together both senior and junior researchers to discuss the theme of the preconference from different interdisciplinary perspectives. The program will include 5 invited speakers (from different disciplines and regions) that will present their work in 45-minute talks, leaving plenty of time for questions and discussion. Moreover, we invite submissions for short talks from researchers of all levels and disciplines.

    "text": "Confirmed speakers\nAnne Bartsch (Leipzig University) specializes in research on media uses and effects, with a special focus on media entertainment and emotional media effects. Her current research deals with the appeal of moving and thought-provoking media experiences and with the effects of such experiences on individuals‚Äô issue involvement, information seeking, and political participation concerning the issues portrayed.\nSuzanne Oosterwijk (University of Amsterdam) is interested in a phenomenon called morbid curiosity (i.e., seeking out images, videos, and stories that detail death, violence, or harm). She will discuss epistemic, eudaimonic, social and affective motives that may explain why people engage with emotionally evocative content.\nDaryl Cameron (Pennsylvania State University) studies why and how people are motivated to empathetically engage with or avoid others‚Äô suffering. Decisions whether or not to share in others‚Äô experiences are based on how people consider costs and benefits of empathy and enact different emotion regulation strategies. He will summarize his work using the empathy selection task to explore motivated empathy regulation about suffering through the lens of situation selection.\nLasana Harris (University College London) studies dehumanised perception as a proactive emotion regulation strategy. His research demonstrates that people predict empathy requirements in impending social interactions and dehumanise when they expect the social interaction to be emotionally taxing. He will discuss research documenting that medical professions engage dehumanised perception to stave off burnout and facilitate better care for their patients.\nMarie Rosenkrantz Lindegaard (Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement) has a background in cultural anthropology and criminology. Her pioneering work on bystander behavior challenged the assumption that bystanders are passive agents, showing that intervention during conflicts, rather than apathy, is the norm."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Non-verbal vocalisations in human-human and human-machine interactions play important roles in displaying social and affective behaviours and in managing the flow of interaction. Laughter, sighs, clicks, filled pauses, and short utterances such as feedback responses are among some of the non-verbal vocalisations that are being increasingly studied from various research fields. However, much is still unknown about the phonetic or visual characteristics of non-verbal vocalisations (production/encoding), their relations to the social actions they are part of, their perceived meanings (perception/decoding), and their ordering in interaction. Furthermore, with the increased interest for more naturalness in human-machine interaction, current times also invite exploring how these phenomena can be integrated in speech applications.\nThe workshop would be in its 7th edition, with previous editions held in Saarbr√ºcken (2007), Berlin (2009), Dublin (2012), Enschede (2015), Paris (2018), and Bielefeld (2020). The goal of this series of workshops is to bring together scientists from diverse research areas and to provide an exchange forum for interdisciplinary discussions in order to gain a better understanding of laughter and other non-verbal vocalisations.\nResearch themes include, but are not restricted to, these aspects of laughter and other non-verbal vocalisations:\nResearchers are invited to submit extended abstracts (2 pages of content and maximum one additional page for references and figures) describing original work, including work in progress.\nThere will be two keynote presentations on the topics treated by the workshop, delivered by Prof.¬†Carolyn McGettigan (University College London, UK) and Prof.¬†Margaret Zellers (Kiel University, Germany)."

However, the extent to which individuals engage in such emotion regulation varies across cultures, partly due to differing beliefs about emotions. In this talk, I will present research highlighting cultural differences in dialectical versus predominantly adverse valuations of emotions. These variations in emotion valuations lead to cultural differences in emotion regulation and have health implications. I will also discuss sociocultural practices that support emotion beliefs and emotion regulation. By illuminating these processes, I will underscore the active role sociocultural contexts play in shaping emotions and their health implications.\n\n\n10:30 - 10:45 Coffee and Tea (the Great Hall)\n\n\n10:45 - 12:00 Parallel Session 1 (PFC / Whitla Hall)\n\n\nPresenterTitleTimeT1: Symposium - Beyond Poses: Perception of Genuine Emotional Expressions (Room Whitla Hall)Yong-Qi CongDifferences in Emotion Perception from Posed and Spontaneous Facial Expressions10:45Xia FangThe Ingroup Advantage in Cross-Cultural Facial Expression Recognition: Influences of Spontaneity and Presentation Mode11:00Anouschka van DijkEmotion Recognition of and Facial Mimicry to Genuine Expressions - In Autism Spectrum Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder11:15T2: Symposium - Exploring the ‚Äúdark‚Äù side of media: fascination with negative content in the digital age (Room Bann: PFC/0G/024)Anastassia Vivanco CarlevariWhy Do People Engage with the Suffering of Strangers?

At the same time, regulators and scientists are raising issues around privacy, evidence of effectiveness, and fairness, culminating in a partial ban of Emotion AI systems in the EU AI Act. In this salon, I will address the challenges and opportunities of creating a start-up in the area of Affective Computing.\n\n\n12:30 - 13:30 Poster Session 1 (South Dining Hall)\n\n\nPresenterTitleNbKaylee R SeddioHeightened Physiological Arousal and Emotional Transference: Prosocial Implications of Narrative Transportation among College Students1Chelsea Rae KellyEmotion Signals by Contemporary Relationship Labels: Modeling Relational Change with Affective Expectation2Deborah TalmiTesting the Ecological Validity of Mechanistic Emotional Memory Models3Manon MulckhuyseThreat-Induced Prosocial Behavior: Enhanced Exogenous Attention to Protect Others from Harm4Christian Becker-AsanoReporting on an Interactive, Public Installation of Android Andrea - Peoples' Reactions and Opinions5Desmond C OngLeveraging Large Language Models to Generate Targeted Reappraisals6Asli ErdemliUncovering the Neural Representation of Epistemic Emotions7Lorna S JakobsonSensory Processing Sensitivity Mediates the Relationship Between Externally Oriented Thinking and Fantasizing8Rian DelaneyDefining Resilience Following a Potentially Traumatic Event in Psychological Research: A Delphi Study9Tatiana PryakhinaTypes of Envy among Russian Speakers on Social Networks10Natalia EspinosaAvoiding the Negativity: An Investigation on Avoided Affect in Mexicans12Annika K KarinenEmotions and Behavioral Intentions in Response to Norm Violations13Martin MK KolnesNot Feeling It: No Emotion Effects on Breadth of Attention14Nevin Solak‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Ruin the Balance of Nature‚Äù: Positive Awe and Threat-Based Awe About Nature and Support for Pro-Environmental Policies During the Pandemic15Megan E GornikMaternal and Preschooler Vocal Expression of Emotions16Riya MishraUnderstanding Microexpressions: The Science of Detecting Hidden Emotions17Rachele LievoreSubjective and Physiological Responses to Social Stress in Pre-Teens with Autism and Specific Learning Disorders18Rathi Adarshi RammohanScraping Auditory Hate Speech from Social Media: A Comparison of Keyword-Based and Channel-Based Approaches19Nicole E.

Studying these artificially created emotional expressions gives researchers a high degree of experimental control. However, it is uncertain to what extent the perception of such stimuli is comparable to emotion perception processes in the real-world. This symposium presents a collective exploration into the perception of spontaneous and genuine emotional expressions. The studies presented here investigate emotion perception from different types of genuine expressions, and the process is investigated in cross-cultural contexts as well as clinical populations. Talk 1 provides a direct and systematic comparison between posed and spontaneous expressions from the same expressers, showing clear differences between the two. Talk 2 continues to demonstrate that real-life spontaneous expressions are poorly recognized, pointing to the important role of context in successful emotion identification. Talk 3 investigates cross-cultural emotion recognition from posed and spontaneous expressions and found spontaneity to influence the size of the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫in-group advantage‚Äö√Ñ√π. Finally, talk 4 explores emotion perception of genuine expressions in two clinical populations, whose emotion recognition deficits have previously been established using only posed expressions. Together, these talks emphasize the importance of using ecologically valid stimuli and paradigms to study non-verbal emotion communication. Our symposium points to the need for the field to move beyond traditional methods of studying emotion perception from non-verbal expressions.\n\n\nTitle: Differences in Emotion Perception from Posed and Spontaneous Facial Expressions\nTime: 10:45-11:00\nAuthors: Yong-Qi Cong, Lidya Yurdum, Agneta Fischer, Disa Sauter\nAbstract: A widely used experimental paradigm in psychological research and clinical assessments involves identifying emotions from facial expressions, typically using posed expressions as stimuli. Perceptions of such stimuli are assumed to mirror those of naturally occurring emotional expressions. However, this assumption has been questioned because the perceptual equivalence of posed and spontaneous expressions has not been empirically established. To address this, we directly compared perceptual judgments of posed and spontaneous facial expressions produced by the same expressers in three pre-registered studies. A total of 2610 perceivers judged the emotions displayed in 1244 dynamic facial expressions of eight emotions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, joy, pride, compassion, and love). Consistent with our main hypothesis, emotions were much better recognised from posed compared to spontaneous expressions, by both Western (Study 1, N=470) and non-Western perceivers (Study 2, N=438). This pattern was replicated in a cross-cultural context in Study 3 (N=1702). Furthermore, in all three studies, we found that negative emotions were better recognised than positive emotions from posed expressions, while the opposite was true for spontaneous expressions. Our findings present clear evidence that perceptions of posed and spontaneous facial expressions meaningfully differ, and raise questions about the generalisability of findings from existing research that uses posed emotional expressions.\n¬†\nTitle: The Ingroup Advantage in Cross-Cultural Facial Expression Recognition: Influences of Spontaneity and Presentation Mode\nTime: 11:00-11:15\nAuthors: Xia Fang, Youxun Ge\nAbstract: In today‚Äôs globalized world, effective cross-cultural communication has become increasingly crucial. Nonverbal cues, particularly facial expressions, play a significant role in conveying emotions during interactions between individuals from different cultural backgrounds. Previous research has established the existence of an ‚Äúingroup advantage,‚Äù whereby individuals are more accurate at recognizing facial expressions displayed by individuals from their own cultural group compared to those from different cultural groups. However, most previous studies have focused on static posed expressions, with limited knowledge about the ingroup advantage in dynamic and spontaneous expressions. To investigate whether the ingroup advantage is modulated by the spontaneity (posed and spontaneous) and presentation mode (static and dynamic) of facial expressions, Chinese and Canadian/Dutch participants were recruited to identify posed and spontaneous angry and disgusted expressions by Chinese and Dutch actors (Experiment 1), as well as static and dynamic expressions of anger and disgust by Chinese and Dutch actors (Experiment 2). The results showed that in most cases, both posed and spontaneous expressions exhibited an ingroup advantage, with such advantage being significantly larger for posed expressions compared to spontaneous expressions. Moreover, both static and dynamic expressions demonstrated an ingroup advantage, with no significant difference between the two overall. These findings suggest that the ingroup advantage in facial expression recognition is influenced by the spontaneity of the expressions but remains unaffected by the presentation mode.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotion Recognition of and Facial Mimicry to Genuine Expressions - In Autism Spectrum Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder\nTime: 11:15-11:30\nAuthors: Anouschka van Dijk, Mariska Kret, Eliska Prochazkova\nAbstract: The ability to understand and mimic emotional expressions is crucial to navigate social environments. Patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) tend to have profound difficulties in the social domain and show deficits in expressing emotion, recognizing emotions and mimicry. Thus far, research into emotion has primarily focused on the perception of explicit, posed facial expressions of emotion. However, real-life emotions are expressed by the whole body, and are typically more ambiguous and can be more difficult to rapidly decipher. To better understand how patients with ASD and SAD perceive emotions in the real world , we chose to present patients with genuine whole-body emotional expressions and measured mimicry levels and emotion recognition. To measure mimicry, we measure facial EMG and skin conductance whilst participants passively view these stimuli, and are asked to label the stimuli afterwards. We are currently in the data collection phase, but will be able to present results during ISRE. We expect to find lower levels of mimicry and decreased emotion recognition for the patients with ASD compared to the typical population and significant differences in mimicry and emotion recognition between the patients with SAD and the typical population. Similarities and differences between the disorders will be discussed."

Yet, some of the media that people enjoy seems to be morbid, disturbing, or even sadistic. Examples include catastrophic news of war or injustice, social media profiles exposing the misfortune of celebrities, stories of real murder cases narrated in podcasts, or viral clips of people failing, hurting, or embarrassing themselves. Intuitively, consuming this negative content may evoke unpleasant emotions like fear, sadness, or worry, and it may be linked to low empathy, aggression, and other maladaptive outcomes. However, in this symposium, we discuss that there are adaptive and important psychological functions behind this engagement with negative content. Speakers will present work on the motives of people engaging with the suffering of strangers (presenter 1), consumption of news related to war and violence (presenter 2), the experience of schadenfreude evoked by media use (presenter 3), and people‚Äö√Ñ√¥s fascination with true crime content (presenter 4). We explore this topic using a wide range of methods including experiments, surveys and self-report, qualitative data, scale development, and neuroscience in order to explain the psychology of engaging with morbid content. In total, this interdisciplinary symposium will illuminate the underlying mechanisms, outcomes and potential benefits of this ‚Äö√Ñ√≤‚Äö√Ñ√∫darker‚Äö√Ñ√π side of media.\n\n\nTitle: Why Do People Engage with the Suffering of Strangers? Exploring Epistemic, Eudaimonic, Social and Affective Motives\nTime: 10:45-11:00\nAuthors: Anastassia Vivanco Carlevari\nAbstract: Reading about violent stories or watching a war documentary are examples in which people voluntarily engage with suffering even knowing that it can be disturbing. Through a mix-method approach, we aim to map the motives for exploring the suffering of distant people. Firstly, in a qualitative study (n=244) participants described situations of suffering and their reasons to engage. The results characterize who was the stranger, what was situations about, how the participant accessed to it and why they decided to do it. We identified four categories of motives: epistemic, eudaimonic, social and affective. Giving an overview of the perceived value of engaging with the situation. In a next step, we aimed to evaluate the relevance and generalizability of these motives depending on specific contexts of suffering and sources of information. Study 2 asked people (n=250) to recall situations in which they engaged with the suffering and then were presented with 32 items to rate how applicable these motives were to their decision. The results show that people engaged with strangers‚Äô suffering to acquire knowledge (e.g.¬†learn something about the world), for personal utility (e.g.¬†to prepare for an emergency), for social utility (e.g.¬†supporting others), and to feel positive (e.g.¬†gratitude) and negative (e.g.¬†outrage) emotions. People report that online media and cultural expressions (e.g., art, books, movies) are significantly more engaging than real-life encounters. These results are interesting to understand the deliberate exploration of human suffering as a motivated phenomenon.\n¬†\nTitle: Why Do We Read News? Identifying the Factors that Promote General and Specific News Consumption\nTime: 11:00-11:15\nAuthors: Ellen O‚ÄôDonoghue\nAbstract: In an age marked by increasing levels of news avoidance, the motivational factors that support news consumption are of interest to researchers, news providers, and consumers alike. Here, we took a data-driven approach toward identifying the factors that promote general news consumption (Experiment 1), as well as news consumption surrounding a specific, negatively valenced world event: the Russia-Ukraine War (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, we created 24 questionnaire items to explore why people consume general news. Through factor analysis, we identified three distinct motivational factors: ‚ÄòInformational Updating‚Äô, ‚ÄòUnderstanding & Sense-Making‚Äô, and ‚ÄòAffect Regulation‚Äô. Among them, ‚ÄòInformational Updating‚Äô was the strongest predictor of consumption frequency: participants with stronger motivations to stay up-to-date consumed news more often. In Experiment 2, we asked whether these same factors would support news consumption surrounding the Russia-Ukraine War. Contrary to Experiment 1, ‚ÄòUnderstanding & Sense-Making‚Äô was the strongest predictor of consumption frequency. Additionally, exploratory analyses suggested a nonlinear relationship between ‚ÄòAffect Regulation‚Äô and consumption frequency: participants with moderate motivations for ‚ÄòAffect Regulation‚Äô consumed news surrounding the Russia-Ukraine War more frequently than participants with strong or weak motivations for ‚ÄòAffect Regulation‚Äô. Our findings suggest that the motivational factors supporting general and specific news consumption may differ, demonstrating a need for more topic- dependent research. Additionally, we highlight several factors that might lead people to seek and/or avoid negative news topics. Continued research surrounding these factors could aid the promotion of healthy news hygiene.\n¬†\nTitle: Explaining Different Shades of Schadenfreude: Why People Feel Pleasure when the Media Show the Misfortunes of Others\nTime: 11:15-11:30\nAuthors: Lilian Suter\nAbstract: Schadenfreude is ‚Äúthe pleasure at the misfortunes of others‚Äù (van Dijk & Ouwerkerk, 2014, p.¬†6). In this talk, I will distinguish different subtypes of schadenfreude, as the pleasure can be grounded in different needs and concerns. I therefore argue that a differentiation is necessary to fully understand the phenomenon of schadenfreude. In this theoretical contribution, I will build on existing work (e.g., Wang et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2009) but also add another layer of differentiation in which I distinguish superficial from profound schadenfreude (cf.¬†Moers, 1930). In profound schadenfreude, different psychological needs and concerns fuel the appraisal of deservingness of a misfortune that is closely linked to the emotion of schadenfreude. This is the area where most scholarly work has been done in the past. In superficial schadenfreude, the definition of ‚Äúpleasure at the misfortunes of others‚Äù still holds true, but the mechanism of pleasure is not grounded in deservingness but more in humor and the violation of expectations. In profound schadenfreude, people feel pleasure because of harm. In superficial schadenfreude, people feel pleasure despite of harm. Finally, I will show how these different subtypes of schadenfreude play a role in certain media formats (fail video clips, sports competitions, reality TV etc.) and how the emotion of schadenfreude can therefore contribute to watching negative content.\n¬†\nTitle: ‚ÄúMurder is My Favorite Medium‚Äù Motives Behind and Outcomes of People‚Äôs Fascination with True Crime\nTime: 11:30-11:45\nAuthors: Corinna Perchtold-Stefan\nAbstract: People‚Äôs fascination with true crime ‚Äì the depiction of real-life crime on TV, social media, or in podcasts seems like a morbid hobby. Yet, true crime media are booming, with the majority of consumers being women. Theories treat enjoyment of true crime either as a maladaptive interest (exposure to violence cultivates fear and aggression) or an adaptive coping mechanism (reduced uncertainty, emotion regulation practice). Given the lack of empirical work on this topic, we conducted a multi-part study on 300-600 true crime fans and not-fans, which included MRI resting-state scans of brain activity to help explain why some people are drawn to true crime, and some are not. Our goal was to answer two central questions: 1) What motives do people report for true crime consumption, and 2) how is it linked to well-being? Our results showed that the primary motive for consuming true crime was making sense of ‚Äúevil‚Äù (~70%), followed by unspecified curiosity (~30%), and interest in the justice system (~27%). Women reported more true crime consumption than men, and a stronger motive of defensive vigilance. Interestingly, true crime consumption was uncorrelated to perceived likelihood of victimization in women, but showed a positive link to feeling unsafe in men. Moreover, true crime consumption showed no meaningful relationships with stress, anxiety, or worry, but was positively linked to problem-oriented reappraisal and negatively to acceptance as emotion regulation strategies. Altogether, our behavioral and neuroscience work suggests that there may be less pathology and more adaptivity in ‚Äúmurder as one‚Äôs favorite medium‚Äù."

Although they start as friends, the relationship soon deepens into ‚Äö√Ñ√∫love‚Äö√Ñ√π. Samantha is talking to thousands of people synchronously, and appears to be in love with many of them. Once Theodore discovers it, he feels bitterly disappointed. His love for Samantha, however, continues to feel very real. The movie raises two central questions. First, can artificial social agents have emotions? Author 1 begins by introducing basic conceptual distinctions useful for discussing artificial emotions, including the distinction between merely mimicking emotions and actually having them, and the distinction between computational, algorithmic, and implementational challenges to embedding emotions in artificial creatures. Author 2 then offers two reasons to think that robots ought to have emotions: ascribing emotions to them may be helpful to increase our ability to predict their behavior, and having emotions may help robots deal with the emergencies they face. Second, can artificial social agents communicate emotions they do not necessarily have, and shape and potentially manipulate the emotions of humans? Author 3 presents a social-functional perspective on emotional expressions, arguing that designers of expressive machines should avoid connecting expressions to feelings, and focus instead on realizing the social functions of expressions in human‚Äö√Ñ√¨machine interactions  Author 4 concludes by discussing two ways robots can affect the emotions of humans: directly through interactions that generate emotional affordances, and indirectly through shaping the human informational environment.\n\n\nTitle: Setting the Stage: How to Frame Questions About Emotions in Artificial Social Agents (ASAs)\nTime: 10:45-11:00\nAuthors: Eva Hudlicka\nAbstract: As ASAs capabilities to display human-like emotions improve, we are increasingly asking whether they can and should have emotions. As computational affective modeling continues to progress, we will soon also begin asking whether these artificial agents do have emotions. And yet we still lack sufficiently precise definitions of emotions that would enable a systematic exploration of these questions. In this talk, I introduce distinctions and concepts that can support a more systematic approach to the topic of emotions in ASAs. First, we need to distinguish between the phenotype (external manifestations) and the genotype (internal implementation) of ASA emotions. Second, we need to distinguish between simulation (reproducing functionality) and emulation (reproducing actual mechanisms) of biological emotions in artificial agents. Third, we need to develop more precise terminology, where different affective state types (emotions, moods) and processes (emotion generation, emotion effects) are defined in terms of the cognitive-affective architectures capable of producing them,asproposedbySloman. Fourth,weneedtodistinguishbetweendescriptiveandmechanistic affective theories. Whereas descriptive theories focus on static characterizations of affective states in terms of their components, mechanistic theories aim to characterize the nature of affective processes. Lastly, to facilitate clearer cross-disciplinary communication and model design, we need to distinguish among different levels of explanation, in both theories and models: computational, algorithmic and implementational, as proposed by Marr and Pylyshyn. I will conclude with some thoughts regarding the importance of characterizing the design space of cognitive-affective architectures that can accommodate both biological and synthetic emotions.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotions in Robots? Good for Us to Ascribe Them, Good for Them to Have Them\nTime: 11:00-11:15\nAuthors: Andrea Scarantino\nAbstract: Should we ascribe emotions to socially interactive robots? In this talk, I will answer that we should, quite independently of whether robot psychology includes causal structures that are anything like human emotions. This Emotional Stance argument is inspired by Dan Dennett‚Äôs Intentional Stance, according to which mental states are to be ascribed to a creature X if that helps us better predict X‚Äôs behavior. On the other hand, we must give up on Dennett‚Äôs assumption of ‚Äòideal rationality‚Äô ‚Äì emotions are going to be usefully ascribed to robots insofar as their behaviors manifest the combination of advantages and occasional rationality failures of emotional behavior. The second part of my talk focuses on a different, Architectural Argument for why robots may need emotions. I begin from Herbert Simon‚Äôs proposal that robots need emotions understood as ‚Äòinterrupt systems‚Äô to handle emergencies. Simon‚Äôs account points us in the right direction, but it misses a key element, namely that emotions do not just interrupt ongoing goal-pursuits, but also provide guidance/instructions for achieving emotion-specific relational goals, in cooperation with higher cognition. I will characterize emotions in robots as ‚Äònotice, interrupt and guide‚Äô computational systems. I conclude by investigating the role consciousness may play in systems of this sort, and what limitations robots who have emotions, but no consciousness of them, may face.\n¬†\nTitle: Social Functions of Machine Emotional Expressions\nTime: 11:15-11:30\nAuthors: Jonathan Gratch, Celso de Melo, Stacy Marsella & Catherine Pelachaud\nAbstract: Socially interactive agents frequently generate behaviors that human observers naturally see as expressing emotion, yet almost never do these expressions reflect something analogous to the machine‚Äôs internal ‚Äúemotional‚Äù state. While some fret this is inherently deceptive, many human emotional expressions similarly do not reflect underlying feelings, but rather are produced to achieve important social functions. For example, an expression of guilt signals a commitment to repair the relationship after a transgression and an expression of surprise signals an expectation violation, but these function can be served without positing a connection to some underlying human or synthetic emotional state. Embracing a social-functional perspective on emotional expressions, we argue that designers of expressive machines should avoid attempts to connect expressions something like a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù, but rather focus on formalizing and realizing these interactional functions. We review psychological findings on how emotional expressions achieve important social functions in human relationships and highlight that artificial emotional expressions can serve analogous functions in human‚Äìmachine interaction. We then review computational methods for determining what expressions make sense to generate within the context of interaction and how to realize those expressions across multiple modalities, such as facial expressions, voice, language, and touch.\n¬†\nTitle: How Could Robots Shape or Exploit Human Emotions?\nTime: 11:30-11:45\nAuthors: Lydia Farina\nAbstract: In this talk, I discuss two ways in which robots could shape human emotions: (1) directly through human/robot interactions by eliciting emotional responses deemed suitable to the context of interaction and (2) indirectly through controlling the informational environments humans dwell in. Because humans tend to adjust emotional behaviour in accordance with environmental affordances, interacting with social robots in a certain context can directly lead to eliciting empathy towards a humanoid robot. In a similar way, in the context of assistive robots, being ‚Äòcared for‚Äô may elicit feelings towards robotic care-takers (Studley and Meacham 2017). In the case of disembodied machines, the indirect shaping can take place by the machines selecting the informational cues one receives relating to news, world affairs etc., which encourages or discourages specific emotional reactions and narratives. In the final part of my talk, I argue that the ability of robots to shape or exploit human emotions does not hinge on robots being agents in any strong sense or on robots having a capacity to experience emotions themselves. Instead, I suggest that the following conditions are necessary: 1) robots must be trained to recognize emotional narratives in the sense of matching stimuli or behavioural expression with emotional performances and 2) robots must be trained to give appropriate context-dependent responses to encourage/discourage emotional narratives. I conclude that the degree of shaping depends on the volume of our interaction with robots, and on the specific purposes (e.g.¬†commercial, educational etc.) of using robots in these environments."

Although a core feature of emotions is that they change over time and those dynamics contain important information about how individuals regulate their emotions, emotion regulation is still often studied as a stable concept. The current multi-method symposium brings together four speakers who emphasize the importance of dynamics in the study of emotions and emotion regulation. The presentations range from methodological contributions to improve the measurement of emotions over research on inter- individual and contextual influences on emotion regulation to novel intervention techniques to improve positive emotions. The first presentation introduces an innovative method for capturing emotion dynamics in Experience Sampling Method (ESM) studies through continuous affect drawings and how this approach enhances the investigation of emotional episodes and regulation processes in daily life. The second presentation showcases how interindividual differences in parental optimism can shape emotion regulation in children. Using observational data on parents and their young children, the study addresses whether interindividual differences in parental optimism are related to dyadic affective flexibility. The third presentation highlights the importance of contextual influences on emotion regulation and presents findings from a daily diary study that assessed emotional context and emotion regulation strategies across 60 days in young adults. The fourth presentation addresses how emotion regulation can be fostered with targeted interventions and presents a study on just-in- time adaptive interventions to improve positive emotion regulation. The discussant will highlight future directions to further advance the study of emotion (regulation) dynamics.\n\n\nTitle: Validating the Level and Timing of Affect Dynamics Through Continuous Affect Drawings\nTime: 10:45-11:05\nAuthors: Leonie Cloos\nAbstract: Experience sampling methods promise the measurement of affect dynamics through repeated assessments. Yet, these are limited to several momentary affect assessments, which may not occur or not be answered when affective events happen. The resulting data may lack important information on affective events and emotion episodes. This has implications for studies aiming to capture emotional experiences and regulation processes. We present an alternative response format that allows participants to draw their affective changes between assessments. With this method, we can obtain time-continuous data in form of a drawing depicting affective responses and regulation. Our research question is to determine periods when the data is most informative. In a one-week experience sampling study, 115 participants rated their momentary positive and negative affect six times a day. From the second assessment onwards they drew their positive and negative affect changes since the previous assessment, reported positive and negative events, and received a daily measurement burst between two random assessments. The goal of the current study is to extract relevant information from the data. Particularly, applying the peak rule we first examine if the maximum and minimum scores of the burst data and the drawing correspond. Secondly, we map self-reported event intensity to the maximum intensity in the drawings. Moreover, applying the end rule, we first study whether the overlap between the burst and drawing strengthens toward the end of a drawing; and secondly how the timing of an event influences the overlap between event intensity and the maximum intensity of the drawing.\n¬†\nTitle: Parental Optimism and Dyadic Affective Flexibility During Interactions Between Parents and their 2.5-Year-Old Children\nTime: 11:05-11:25\nAuthors: Charlotte Vrijen\nAbstract: There is evidence that optimists experience better physical and mental health and a higher quality of life compared to pessimists. The benefits of optimism may even transmit to the next generation. Our aim is to study to what extent and how parental optimism shapes the lives of offspring. We hypothesize that optimistic parents are generally more effective in regulating their emotions and transmit these skills to the next generation. To test this hypothesis, we study whether parental optimism predicts more dyadic affective flexibility during interactions between parents and their young children (~ age 2.5). Parent-child dyadic affective flexibility refers to the ability of a parent and child to adjust to contextual demands by shifting between emotional states together and is an early precursor of adaptive emotion regulation. Data are used from a large-scale longitudinal cohort study. Parental optimism is assessed with the self-report Life Orientation Test (LOT-R). Videotaped observations of parent-child interactions during goal-directed tasks that include a frustration are used to code child and parent affect (negative externalizing, negative internalizing, neutral, interest, and positive) with an adapted version of the SPecific Affect (SPAFF) coding system. Dyadic affective flexibility is derived from state space grids in Mangold INTERACT. Videos are currently being coded and first results based on ~ 80 child-parent dyads will be presented and discussed at the symposium. If parent-child dyadic affective flexibility is indeed higher for more optimistic parents, this may indicate important advantages of optimism for the next generation.\n¬†\nTitle: incReasIng poSitive Emotions (RISE Project): A Pilot Study on a Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention in Daily Life\nTime: 11:25-11:45\nAuthors: Eeske van Roekel\nAbstract: Improving positive emotion regulation is essential in preventing mental health problems and increasing well-being. An effective way to improve positive emotions (PE) is through positive psychology interventions. While previous Experience Sampling Method (ESM) studies demonstrated that providing one-time personalized ESM-based feedback increases PE, there is large heterogeneity in effectiveness. An important next step is to further personalize interventions through ‚Äújust-in-time adaptive interventions‚Äù (JITAI), by identifying the optimal timing and content of the intervention. The present study examines the feasibility of providing micro-interventions during low versus high positive emotion moments in a sample of first-year university students (N = 139). Participants enrolled in a 15-day baseline period, after which they were randomly assigned to the intervention group (N = 70) who continues with the ESM for another 14 days and receives the JITAI, or an active control group (N= 69) who only continues with the ESM. Subsequently, all participants continued with another 15 days of ESM. The initial cohort (N = 52) showed high compliance with the ESM (75%), and with the interventions (90-95%). Compared to the control group, the intervention group reported to be better able to cope with negative emotions, and to feel better about themselves due to the study. Changes in outcome variables will be presented during the conference, as data from the ongoing second cohort are currently collected. This research underscores the potential of personalized, timely micro-interventions in amplifying positive emotions and well-being, offering valuable insights for mental health interventions.\n¬†\nTitle: Discussion\nTime: 11:45-12:00\nAuthors: van Roekel, Eeske"

Existing literature, however, is often based on WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) contexts‚Äîwhich raises questions about generalizability of results. To provide more information from majority-world contexts, this project examines the emotion regulation strategies present in children (6 and 10 years of age) from Mexico City (N = 43) and from small-scale indigenous Yucatec Maya communities around Chemax, Mexico (N = 39). Children were asked to recall memories of when they recently felt sad, angry, scared, or embarrassed before being asked what they did to make themselves feel better. Responses were later transcribed and coded for different emotion regulation strategies. Results from between subjects ANOVAs for age group and sample demonstrated that older children reported using a broader general repertoire [F(1, 78) = 4.79, p = .03, Œ∑ = .06] and a greater number of regulatory attempts for sad memories [F(1, 78) = 6.42, p = .01, Œ∑ = .08] than younger children. Furthermore, Yucatec Maya children reported more instances of attempts at goal change than children from Mexico City, F(1, 78) = 8.67, p = .004, Œ∑ = .10. Planned analyses will further explore links between specific strategies and discrete emotion contexts. While more work is necessary, this study provides novel information about children‚Äôs emotion regulation strategy use outside of Western contexts.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotion Regulation Strategies and Psychological Health Across Cultures\nTime: 11:00-11:15\nAuthors: Tamir, Maya; Miyamoto, Yuri; Chentsova-Dutton, Yulia\nAbstract: Emotion regulation is important for psychological health, and can be achieved by implementing various strategies. How one regulates emotions is critical for maximizing psychological health. Few studies, however, tested the psychological correlates of different emotion regulation strategies across multiple cultures. In a pre-registered cross-cultural study (N=3,960, 19 countries), conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed associations between the use of seven emotion regulation strategies (situation selection, distraction, rumination, cognitive reappraisal, acceptance, expressive suppression, emotional support seeking) and four indices of psychological health (life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and loneliness). Model comparisons based on Bayesian Information Criteria provided support for cultural differences in 36% of associations, with very strong support for differences in 18% of associations. Strategies that were linked to worse psychological health in individualist countries (e.g., rumination, expressive suppression) were unrelated or linked to better psychological health in collectivist countries. Cultural differences in associations with psychological health were most prominent for expressive suppression and rumination, and also found for distraction and acceptance. In addition, we found evidence for cultural similarities in 46% of associations between strategies and psychological health, but none of this evidence was very strong. Cultural similarities were most prominent in associations of psychological health with emotional support seeking. These findings highlight the importance of considering the cultural context to understand how individuals from diverse backgrounds manage unpleasant emotions.\n¬†\nTitle: The Role of Afrocultural Ethos in African American Youth‚Äôs Emotion Skill Development\nTime: 11:15-11:30\nAuthors: Lozada, Fantasy T\nAbstract: The current research on African American youth‚Äôs emotional development yields an incomplete understanding of the cultural influences that shape their emotion-related. To understand the emotional development of African American youth, we must explore emotion-related skills in ways that are inclusive of African American‚Äôs multiple cultural experiences. We must also be clear that the exploration of minoritized cultural experiences (e.g., racism, racial socialization, and racial coping) do not capture the whole or even always the most salient aspects of African American experiences regarding emotional development. Although understanding the role of racism in African American youth‚Äôs emotional lives is of the utmost importance (Lozada et al., 2022), the exclusive focus on racism limits the building of a developmental affective science that reflects the full range of emotional experiences of African American youth. In the current paper, I consider Boykin (1986) and colleagues‚Äô (1985) articulation of the Triple Quandary Theory as the framework for multiple cultural influences: a mainstream cultural influence (reflective of white, European American values), a minority cultural influence (reflective of the navigation and coping with racial oppression), and a Black cultural influence (reflective of Afrocultural values intergenerationally transmitted from various Western African philosophies). I also discuss Afrocultural ethos (see Figure 1) as an aspect of African American cultural experiences that shapes African American emotional development, using affect and orality as examples that can be explored within emotional development research and leveraged for future efforts to address African American youths‚Äô emotional health and wellness (see Table 1).\n¬†\nTitle: Methodological and Cultural Considerations when Studying Emotions: A Perspective from Hawai ªi\nTime: 11:30-11:45\nAuthors: Aumer, Katherine V; Blake, Robert; Gray, Kristin; Ford, Ke ªala\nAbstract: Several studies provide strong evidence for the influence of contextual factors with emotion perception and question the robustness of evidence supporting the universality of emotions; suggesting that the evidence may be an artifact of the method (Gendron, 2017; Gendron et al., 2015; Hoemann et al.¬†2019). Most may agree that emotion perception is a complex interplay of various processes across cultures. In this talk, we present three lessons learned while studying love and hate in Hawaiian culture. This talk is intended to bolster the process of cross-cultural studies of emotion as well as highlight pragmatic considerations when studying emotions in cultures with less representation in the emotion science literature. The three lessons we will discuss are: (1) Identity, (2) History, and (3) Trust. First, identity will be discussed both as a factor of the researchers and in terms of group membership when defining culture. Many places conflate, combine, or provide unwritten rules about cultural group membership that can make identification of population challenging. History will be discussed in relation to the emotions investigated. For example, in Hawai ªi love and hate have complex meanings that not only have a linguistic translation, but a political and religious translation. This is not unique to Hawai ªi and being informed about the history of an emotion in an area is important to informing the design of the study. Finally, trust will be discussed in terms of recruitment of participants and the intellectual humility involved in studying concepts that are not traditionally investigated.\n¬†\nTitle: Associations Between Parent Stress and Emotion Regulation and Child Socioemotional Adjustment in Chinese and Mexican American Immigrant Families\nTime: 11:45-12:00\nAuthors: Roach, Erika\nAbstract: Introduction: Children‚Äôs socioemotional adjustment is positively associated with developmental outcomes including peer relationships, academic outcomes, and psychological wellbeing. Research has demonstrated that parental emotion regulation and positive expressivity are positively associated with child emotion regulation, while parent stress and negative expressivity are negatively associated with child emotion regulation. Given the influence of culture on emotion values and expression, these findings warrant investigation on a cross-cultural level. The present study examined relations between parental stress, emotion regulation and emotional expression, and child socioemotional adjustment in 90 parent-child dyads from low-income Chinese American (CA) and Mexican American (MA) immigrant families ‚Äìtwo of the largest and fastest growing immigrant populations in the U.S. Method: Participants included 44 CA and 46 MA parents and their children. Parents completed validated measures assessing parental stress, parental emotion regulation, and child socioemotional adjustment, as well as sociodemographic variables. Parental emotion expression during an interactive parent-child puzzle task was coded by bilingual coders of Chinese and Mexican descent. Results: Parental use of cognitive reappraisal was positively associated with child prosocial behavior in CA children and negatively associated with internalizing behavior in MA children and externalizing behavior in CA children. Cognitive reappraisal was not associated with parent distress in either CA or MA parents but was negatively associated with parent-child dysfunctional interaction in CA parents. Interestingly, while expressive suppression was not associated with parent distress in either CA or MA parents, it was positively associated with parent-child dysfunctional interaction in CA dyads and with internalizing behavior in CA children. Conclusion: Immigrant families face unique stressors and it is important to identify potential buffers against poor psychological outcomes in this population. Our findings indicate that culturally appropriate interventions to support parental use of cognitive reappraisal may be beneficial for children‚Äôs socioemotional outcomes in CA and MA immigrant families. Furthermore, clinicians might consider supporting parents in weighing the advantages and disadvantages of engaging in expressive suppression, given its association with child socioemotional difficulties."

Although a vast amount of qualitative literature has discussed the (un)desirable impact of emotions on sentencing decisions, it is currently unknown what empirical research has revealed about the influence of a defendant‚Äôs emotions on legal decisions. Furthermore, where discussion about defendants‚Äô emotions mainly centers around remorse, the role that emotions other than remorse play remains unclear. The goal of the current systematic literature review is to fill these knowledge gaps. More specifically, this review aims to scrutinize the available literature to see whether defendants‚Äô emotions influence guilt and sentencing decisions. As such, this systematic review aims to explore whether an ‚Äòemotional defendant effect‚Äô exists. A synthesis of the literature suggests that the expression of emotion by defendants might be beneficial in terms of guilt and sentencing decisions as compared to showing no emotion. However, this finding does not account for all emotions. Furthermore, the effect of a defendant‚Äôs emotionality on legal decisions includes a set of boundary conditions (moderators), and is almost exclusively found in student samples. It is important for legal professionals to be able to gain knowledge about the rich palette of emotions defendants can experience, how they arise, and how they are expressed, to make informed decisions.\n¬†\nTitle: Rational Anger - Hostile Emotions in the Legal Procedure\nTime: 11:00-11:15\nAuthors: Bergman Blix, Stina; T√∂rnqvist, Nina\nAbstract: Anger plays a peculiar role in modern legal systems. On the one hand, anger strongly links with appraisals of wrongdoing and attributions of blame, forming a core rationale for legal decision-making. On the other hand, anger is associated with irrational behaviour and biased decisions, and thus poses an immediate threat to objectivity and legal professionalism. The forthcoming book that this presentation builds on, explores the role anger plays in the legal process by comparing how anger emerges, evolves and is resolved in the work of judges and prosecutors in Italy, Sweden and USA. Drawing on observations, interviews, and shadowing of legal professionals we demonstrate how anger and other hostile emotions are entangled with legal thought and come into play in legal practices. While anger is often conceived of as spontaneous and irrational, we elucidate the moral, temporal, and framing aspects of legal institutionalized anger that often goes unnoticed and becomes disassociated from its emotional foundation. The interplay between anger and legal processes is of particular interest since a well-functioning judicial system depends on people‚Äôs trust in objective and rational justice and, as we will show, anger is both inherent to and threatens this process. The comparative approach allows us to identify differences across countries but also link the way anger is approached, displayed and employed beyond the national emotional regime of each country. The study builds on sociological emotion theory and a social interactionist framework in dialogue with the growing socio-legal field of law and emotions.\n¬†\nTitle: In Judges We Trust ‚Äì the Collective Dynamic of Epistemic Independence\nTime: 11:15-11:30\nAuthors: T√∂rnqvist, Nina; Bergman Blix, Stina\nAbstract: Autonomy and independence are key features of legal decision-making. Yet, decision-making in court is fundamentally interactional and collective, both during the information gathering phase of hearings, and in evaluations during deliberations. Depending on legal system and type of court, deliberations can include different constellations of lay judges, jurors, or judge panels. Here, we explore how judges in Sweden organize the decision-making process in order to integrate independent decision-making within a collective social order. In particular, we focus on the emotional undercurrents of the decision-making process ‚Äî how emotions such as trust, mistrust, doubt, and certainty, guide the interaction rituals involved and motivate rational inferences. Theoretically, the paper departs from an emotive-cognitive judicial framework, which understands emotion and reason as intersecting and continuous. By adding an interactionist perspective, we unveil the collaborative efforts of objective decision-making and critical assessments of evidence. How do legal decision-makers secure independence while seeking consensus? The analysis builds on extensive ethnographic fieldwork in Sweden, including shadowing and interviews with judges as well as observations during court proceedings and deliberations. The paper actualizes the importance of objectivity work as a joint accomplishment and contributes with a nuanced account of how the decision-making process unfolds in the criminal justice process.\n¬†\nTitle: Social Stress, Support, and the Reproduction of Biased U.S. Policing\nTime: 11:30-11:45\nAuthors: Powelson, Connor\nAbstract: Studies of police emotions often focus on the management of feelings associated with traumatic, tragic, and dangerous events. However, a growing source of stress for police, particularly in the U.S., comes from increasing public outcries for accountability and reform. Examining how officers‚Äô social identities and emotional workplace experiences are reciprocally related to perceptions of public scrutiny, the present study considers how interactions between emotion cultures shape organizational practices. The identities and feelings of police and nonpolice weave unexpected networks of friends and foes and guide how each should be treated. Drawing upon more than 60 in-depth interviews conducted with police officers before, during, and after the George Floyd protests (2020), I explore how officer social identities and perceptions of the protests pattern the types of social stressors they are exposed to and the social support that is available to them. Findings reveal how relations to emotion cultures pattern emotional inequalities. Emotion processes reproduce racialized and gendered status hierarchies within and beyond the policing institution and contribute to shared understandings of police as biased. Ultimately, this work speaks to an understanding of police agencies as racialized organizations that maintain an emotional substructure that patterns inequitable rules, resources, and their justifications (Ray 2019)."

Thus, attention has turned toward a better understanding of the relative success of using one or more strategies beyond frequency of use. The presentations in this symposium are all attempts to advance our understanding of how success may vary as a function of situational (intensity, controllability, motivations), social, and cross-cultural factors. Presentation 1 begins by examining success in two ways and how this is impacted by using multiple regulation strategies in combination. Presentation 2 examines one strategy, expressive suppression more thoroughly to reveal that motivation to protect self and other both predicted regulatory success. The next 2 presentations consider strategy-situation fit and regulatory flexibility. Presentation 3 found that both strategy type and situational characteristics impact success, but not the interaction of the two. Presentation 4 combines four studies that provide evidence challenging the theoretical expectation that strategy-situation fit and flexibility result in better regulation. Presentation 5 expands this line of inquiry to compare strategy use and success across 51 countries. Taken together, these studies illuminate various aspects of successful emotion regulation in ways that both add to the body of empirical findings in the field as well as work toward improvements in theory.\n\n\nTitle: Hedonic and Perceived Success of Adolescent Emotion Regulation as a Function of Emotion Intensity and Polyregulation Repertoires\nTime: 13:30-13:45\nAuthors: Tom Hollenstein\nAbstract: Unlike adult emotion regulation strategy research, adolescent research remains limited and oversimplified. Specifically, there has been little consideration of the relative success of various strategies. Further, despite research on strategy repertoires, there have been no examinations of polyregulation, or the use of multiple strategies during the same emotional event. Hence, we do not yet understand the maturation of these process or their effectiveness. As a first step in this direction, we present experience sampling data on 154 13‚Äì15-year-olds who provided 4 reports/day for 14 days (6216 observations) on: emotional intensity of most negative event since last prompt, regulatory effort for each of 6 strategies (1-10 scale), current emotional intensity, and Perceived Success (1-10). Hedonic Success was calculated as initial minus current intensity. Polyregulation was calculated as a Sum Index (sum of 6 ratings). Correlations between Hedonic and Perceived Success were .19 (within) and .26 (between), indicating these indices may reflect different aspects of success. We ran 2 multilevel mediation models with Initial Intensity as predictor, Sum Index as mediator, and either Hedonic or Perceived Success as outcome. For Perceived Success, there was a within-level indirect effect, but no between-level indirect effect. For Hedonic Success there was both a between-level and within-level indirect effect of the Sum index. Findings indicate youth distinguish between changes in emotional intensity and how they perceive their relative success (i.e., not escalating may be perceived as successful). Importantly, polyregulation seems to have an impact on both hedonic change and perceptions of success.\n¬†\nTitle: What is the Relationship Between Emotion Intensity, Motivation, and Expressive Suppression Success?\nTime: 13:45-14:00\nAuthors: Megan Wylie\nAbstract: Successful expressive suppression (ES) has been linked to emotion intensity, as more intense emotions are more difficult to suppress. However, other situational aspects of ES use, such as motivation, might also play an important role in ES success. We considered two motivational possibilities: motivation to protect oneself (e.g., from judgements about emotions) and motivation to protect others (e.g., from hurt feelings). Greater ES success might be linked to greater motivation overall, but also more closely to a specific type of motivation. The primary aim of this study was to use experience- sampling to capture situational changes in emotion intensity and two ES motivations as predictors of ES success. Undergraduates (N = 156, 92.3% women) were prompted on their smartphones to complete four ESM questionnaires per day for 10 days, including questions about emotion intensity, motivation (to protect self and other), and success for negative and positive events. Multilevel models revealed that for negative events, emotion intensity did not predict success, but motivation to protect self (b = .09, p &lt; .001) and protect others (b = .16, p &lt; .001), and the interaction between emotion intensity and protect others (b = -.03, p = .02) predicted success. For positive events, emotion intensity (b = .13, p &lt; .001), and motivation to protect self (b = .08, p = .02) and protect others (b = .13, p &lt; .001) predicted success. These findings expand our understanding of ES use and highlight the role that motivation plays in ES success across different contexts.\n¬†\nTitle: A Matter of Fit? Investigating the Effects of Strategy-Situation Fit on Perceived Emotion Regulation Success\nTime: 14:00-14:15\nAuthors: Tabea Springstein\nAbstract: Research on emotion regulation (ER) flexibility has shown that using ER strategies in situation dependent ways might be beneficial for long-term well-being. Theories on ER flexibility propose that flexible individuals are those who select ER strategies that help them successfully regulate their emotions by achieving their situation-specific momentary ER goals. ER is driven by goals to up- or down-regulate positive or negative emotions, sometimes for specific superior motives (e.g., to make a good impression). In daily life, ER success is often assessed by whether positive emotions are maximized and negative emotions are minimized, which can miss occasions in which goals do not center on maximizing hedonic benefits. Assessing people‚Äôs perceptions of their ER success more closely captures whether or not their idiosyncratic ER goals were achieved and helps thoroughly test the momentary benefits of situation-specific ER. Therefore, our study investigated whether individuals report being more or less successful in their momentary ER when the strategy they select corresponds to situational demands. In an experience sampling study with 216 individuals, we asked 7 times a day for 14 consecutive days about use of 8 ER strategies, 9 situational appraisals, and perceived ER success over the past 2 hours. While some predicted effects emerged, such as minimizing being more detrimental for ER success in controllable (vs.¬†uncontrollable) situations, results largely indicate that ER success depends on strategies or situations but not on their interactions. Our results will be discussed in the context of short-term versus long-term consequences of ER and ER flexibility.\n¬†\nTitle: Do People Regulate Their Emotions Flexibly in Daily Life and Does It Matter? Evidence from Four Intensive Longitudinal Studies\nTime: 14:15-14:30\nAuthors: Peter Koval\nAbstract: Recent emotion regulation theories have eschewed traditional distinctions between ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô and ‚Äòunhealthy‚Äô strategies. Instead, many scholars consider flexibility as the basis of optimal emotion regulation. A key component of regulatory flexibility involves context-sensitive use of regulation strategies to match situational demands: strategy- situation fit. We examined whether people match emotion-regulation efforts to daily contexts and the proposed benefits of strategy-situation fit. We conducted a 14-day diary study (N=254), two observational experience-sampling studies (Ns=179 & 123), and an experimental experience-sampling study (N=181), in which participants reported momentary/daily affect, use of several emotion-regulation strategies, and appraisals of events/contexts (Total N=737). Analyses focussed on strategy-situation fit for (a) reappraisal with controllability; (b) reappraisal and distraction with intensity; and (c) expressive suppression and social sharing with social support. Regulation strategies varied systematically across contexts, although not always as hypothesized. As predicted, greater social support predicted less suppression and more sharing. However, contrary to theory, distraction did not increase in more intense contexts, and reappraisal did not increase in more intense or more controllable situations. Further, we found virtually no evidence for context-dependent effects of regulation strategies on affect, or associations between individual differences in strategy-situation fit and well-being. Findings suggest that although people‚Äôs use of some emotion-regulation strategies may be context-dependent, this does not always match theory. Further, context-sensitive strategy use does not appear to influence either short-term affective consequences, or to have longer-term advantages for well-being. Overall, findings cast doubt on the theorized benefits of strategy-situation fit and, more generally of flexible emotion regulation.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotion Regulation and Wellbeing: A Cross-Cultural Study Across 51 Countries\nTime: 14:30-14:45\nAuthors: Disa Sauter\nAbstract: The ability to effectively manage negative emotions is crucial for healthy psychological functioning. However, knowledge on how emotion regulation relates to wellbeing is primarily based on lab studies, focused on a subset of emotion regulation strategies, and conducted among individuals from a very limited range of cultures. Here, we report the most comprehensive study to date of the relationship between emotion regulation and wellbeing. We examined the unique contributions of the use of six key emotion regulation strategies to wellbeing among 23,865 participants from 51 countries, using a wide variety of cultural orientations. In line with our pre-registered hypotheses, acceptance and reappraisal predicted higher wellbeing, while rumination and suppression predicted lower wellbeing. Social sharing and distraction yielded more mixed findings. Acceptance and rumination were particularly strong predictors of wellbeing, thus emerging as the promise and peril of emotion regulation. These effects were largely replicated in two separate representative samples (N = 2000). Finally, there was a great degree of cross-cultural consistency in both the use of emotion regulation strategies, and in their associations with wellbeing. These findings demonstrate that emotion regulation strategies ‚Äì particularly acceptance and rumination ‚Äì are key to wellbeing across cultures."

Presenters will discuss multiple competencies that are part of ability-EI models, providing both original theoretical reflections (notably, the relationship between EI and hypersensitivity, as well as the role of social context in emotion recognition) and innovative ideas in the measurement of EI, with the introduction of new theory-driven context-specific measures, and testing the potential contribution of artificial intelligence. The first two talks present studies that test the original theoretical hypothesis that high EI individuals are characterized by hypersensitivity toward emotional stimuli; more precisely, these studies investigate how EI relates to the perceptual threshold for identifying emotional expressions and how it influences emotional mimicry. Their results are discussed in the context of the hypersensitivity hypothesis and the implications for the conceptualization and applications of EI. The symposium continues by deepening on the role of the social context on emotion recognition ability (ERA), and how ERA can predict synchronization of nonverbal behavior during dyadic interactions. The last two presentations expand the focus by suggesting new directions for the measurement of EI. The fourth talk introduces an innovative instrument for measuring EI that strongly integrates emotion theory and applies to a specific and understudied real-world context: hospitality. The last talk presents a series of surprising studies that show how well artificial intelligence can perform emotionally intelligent tasks and what this may imply for the future of EI.\n\n\nTitle: Emotional Intelligence and Threshold of Perception of Emotional Expressions: Further Evidence of Emotional Hypersensitivity\nTime: 13:30-13:45\nAuthors: Marina Fiori, Christelle Gillioz, & Maroussia Nicolet-Dit-F√©lix\nAbstract: A recent theoretical framework posits that emotional intelligence (EI) is profoundly shaped by an individual‚Äôs responsiveness to emotional stimuli, suggesting that high EI is contingent upon heightened emotional sensitivity. Aligned with this idea, initial evidence show that high EI individuals have an attentional bias towards emotional faces, and that they provide more polarized perceptions of emotional expressions. The current study aims to test an additional feature of the hypersensitivity of high EI individuals, namely the perceptual threshold for effective discrimination of emotional expressions. By manipulating the quantity of signal available in static and dynamic faces, we hypothesized that the signal threshold needed to correctly categorize an expression would be lower for high EI individuals. One hundred three participants executed an emotion recognition task in which the six basic emotions were shown with varying noise applied on the face. For each participant, a detection threshold was computed, which corresponds to an evaluation of the percentage of information needed to recognize the face with 44% accuracy (16% = chance). Linear mixed effects models were employed to predict the perception threshold. Preliminary results show a lower threshold of accurate discrimination of blurred emotional expressions in high EI individuals. Effects appear stronger for the emotion recognition facet, marginally significant for emotion understanding, and significant for emotion management in interaction with different emotions. Results are discussed in light of the hypersensitivity hypothesis according to which EI is greatly influenced by one‚Äôs level of emotional sensitivity.\n¬†\nTitle: Is Emotional Intelligence Associated with more Reaction to Emotions? a Study on Mimicry and Emotional Contagion.\nTime: 13:45-14:00\nAuthors: Christelle Gillioz, Maroussia Nicolet-Dit-F√©lix, & Marina Fiori\nAbstract: We investigated whether and how emotional intelligence (EI) influences emotional contagion and mimicry. Participants (144 females) watched positive and negative videos in three different conditions: with no specific instructions (natural condition), with the instructions to put themselves in the character‚Äôs shoes (internal condition) and with the instructions to distinguish themselves from the character (external condition). Participants took part in all conditions. The activity of the corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major muscles was recorded and after each video, the participants reported the arousal and valence corresponding to their emotion during the video. The EI facets emotion recognition (ER), emotion understanding (EU), and emotion management (EM) were measured. Participants‚Äô arousal and mimicry increased in the internal condition compared to the natural condition and then decreased in the external condition. Although there was no effect of EI on reported arousal and valence, EI, specifically EU and EM, influenced mimicry during the task. In the natural and internal conditions, EU predicted a greater difference in zygomaticus activation between positive and negative videos, suggesting that individuals high on this EI facet may react more to emotion of others. In all conditions, EM predicted less corrugator activation when watching negative videos, suggesting that individuals high on this EI facet may spontaneously regulate their negative emotions. Results will be discussed according to the hypersensitivity hypothesis, which states that EI enhances emotional experience.\n¬†\nTitle: Decoding Social Dynamics: The Impact of Emotion Recognition Ability on Nonverbal Behavior in Positive and Negative Interactions\nTime: 14:00-14:15\nAuthors: Nils R. Sommer & Katja Schlegel\nAbstract: Emotion recognition ability (ERA), a key component of emotional intelligence, is expected to be beneficial for managing social interactions. Previous studies have shown that higher ERA is linked to more facial mimicry, producing more accurate nonverbal expressions, and better social interaction outcomes. However, limited research has explored ERA‚Äôs impact on nonverbal behavior in social contexts. Our study addresses this gap by investigating ERA within positive and negative social interactions involving friendly and unfriendly confederates, respectively. We employed three measures to evaluate participants‚Äô nonverbal behavior: Observer ratings, computerized facial action recognition using OpenFace, and the synchrony of movements between participants and confederates (nonverbal synchrony). We hypothesized that individuals with higher ERA would exhibit greater overall nonverbal synchrony and demonstrate more positive facial expressivity in positive interactions and increased negative facial expressivity in negative interactions due to heightened emotional mimicry. One hundred fifty participants took part in videotaped interactions with either friendly or unfriendly confederates in the laboratory. Our results revealed that higher ERA predicted increased nonverbal synchrony between interactants. However, ERA did not significantly influence observer-rated expressivity in positive or negative interactions. This study contributes essential evidence to enhance our understanding of the relationship between ERA and nonverbal behavior in social interactions, shedding light on the nuanced dynamics of emotional intelligence in social contexts.\n¬†\nTitle: Putting the HEART to Use: A New Assessment of Emotional Competencies for Hospitality.\nTime: 14:15-14:30\nAuthors: Juliane V√∂lker & Marcello Mortillaro\nAbstract: Endeavours to measure emotional intelligence (EI) in workplace contexts have flourished over the past years, yet no measure is so far available that is specialised to hospitality workplaces. Past research has shown that fashioning an assessment tool to its intended context is crucial. Therefore, we created a test of emotional competencies for hospitality employees: the HEART (Hospitality‚Äôs Emotional & Affective Resources Test). Founded on ability EI theory, we used a multimodal and situational judgment-based test design to assess four emotional competencies: emotion recognition, understanding, regulation of own emotions, and management of emotions of others. We created original, realistic scenario-based items from interviews with 47 industry professionals and recorded new videos with professional actors. We conducted seven validation studies (total N = 699) with samples of hospitality students and professionals in Germany, Switzerland, and the US. HEART modules were sufficiently consistent for a performance-based test (mean McDonald‚Äôs œâ = .527 on the single modules across studies, mean œâ = .713 for the whole test). Performance on the HEART was strongly associated with other measures of EI (STEM-B, STEU-B, WLEIS) and moderately associated with cognitive intelligence (CFT). We found weak to moderate associations with self-reported adaptive emotion regulation (CERQ) and Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Openness (TIPI). A strong association was found with job satisfaction. Results will be discussed in the light of future applications and refinements of the test.\n¬†\nTitle: Exploring ChatGPT‚Äôs Performance in Solving and Creating Emotional Intelligence Tests\nTime: 14:30-14:45\nAuthors: Katja Schlegel, Nils R. Sommer, & Marcello Mortillaro\nAbstract: Despite their expertise in various knowledge domains, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are often believed to lack empathy and emotional intelligence (EI). This study aimed to explore this assumption by assessing ChatGPT‚Äôs performance in solving and creating test items for two components of EI ‚Äì emotion understanding (identifying emotions in vignettes) and emotion management (identifying the most effective way to regulate an emotion in oneself or others). Initially, ChatGPT (GPT-4) outperformed human participants on the Geneva Emotion Knowledge Test (GEMOK-Blends), Situational Tests of Emotion Understanding (STEU) and Emotion Management (STEM) and Geneva Emotional Competence Test (GECo ‚Äì Emotion Regulation and Emotion Management subtests), correctly solving 86% of items versus the human average of 56% in the original validation studies. In a second step, ChatGPT generated new items for each of these five tests. Across five studies with 467 participants, both the original and ChatGPT-created tests were compared. Results showed that the original and ChatGPT-created versions were similar in difficulty (62% vs.¬†63% correct) and reliability (mean Cronbach‚Äôs alpha = .54 vs.¬†.50). Both versions were substantially correlated (mean r =.44) and perceived as equally clear and realistic, although the item content of the ChatGPT- created test versions was judged as less diverse (small effect). The original tests had marginally stronger correlations with external EI and vocabulary measures. These results demonstrate ChatGPT‚Äôs capacity to solve and create EI test items effectively, challenging the notion that LLMs lack human interaction skills."

For example, virtual agents that detect people‚Äö√Ñ√¥s health problems early and could help them find relevant clinical practices, or virtual reality exposure therapy that trains people with phobias to face their fear gradually in a safe environment. This symposium consists of four presentations related to this topic and it will be followed with a discussion. We will first present the research findings related to emotion in clinical groups. What specific traits do patients have? How avatars can be used in studying emotion processing in patients? Second, we will present practical findings on how people perceive virtual human‚Äö√Ñ√¥s emotional expressions and the influence of social anxiety. Third, we will present a new project about the development of an emotion training tool that makes use of non-acted emotion expression data. As the final presentation, we will show virtual reality applications for vulnerable groups, including how they could be designed and the challenges that exist when researching such applications. After all the presentations, we will have a discussion session where we could discuss the conclusions and future research, and answer some final questions.\n\n\nTitle: Avatars in the Study of Emotion Processing in Patients with Mental Illnesses\nTime: 13:30-13:45\nAuthors: Katja K√∂lkebeck\nAbstract: In people with mental illness, interaction problems can frequently be identified. It was theorized that reasons for problems in social interaction in patients with mental illness can be found in the disturbed perception and processing as well as imitation (mimicry) of body signals. In the last years, specifically for people with autism, avatars have been used to create more ecologically valid paradigms to investigate interaction problems including the measurement of bodily signals in reaction to the complex interactions. We will present a study where we examined patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) as well as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Here, marker signals for social exchange during interactional tasks (emotion recognition, trust/investment game) were measured: muscle movements in the face using an electromyography (EMG) examination, pupil size and skin conductance of the participants. This included also the use of an avatar in a social task. Moreover, we will present an ongoing project that uses avatars to create environments for social interaction as a means to gather biological signals to identify specific markers for the autistic spectrum as compared to other mental illnesses. Our research serves to identify theoretical foundations of social interaction and to test new theories on the connection between body signals and the development of attachment, but in the long term also to improve the way we deal with patients and train their social interaction skills.\n¬†\nTitle: Social Anxiety and the Perception of Virtual Human‚Äôs Emotional Expressions\nTime: 13:45-14:00\nAuthors: Evania Fasya, Esther van den Bos, Dirk Heylen, Mariska Kret\nAbstract: There are increasing applications of virtual humans, such as in healthcare or virtual assistance, which require humans to interact with virtual humans. This then raises questions; how do people perceive the virtual human‚Äôs emotional expressions? Do individual differences such as social anxiety play a role in the interaction? In this talk, we present a few studies that are related to these questions. We investigate how people perceive the virtual human‚Äôs emotional expressions, in terms of mimicry, liking, and trust. We also explore the social effects of subtle emotional cues such as pupil dilations. We made use of different experimental tasks; a listening task where participants listened and watched virtual humans telling a story, and a speaking task where participants gave a speech to a virtual audience. In the speaking task, we investigate how the virtual audience‚Äôs condition, such as encouraging or critical, could influence the participant‚Äôs evaluations of the virtual audience and anxiety during the task.\n¬†\nTitle: An Interactive Mobile Emotion Training Tool\nTime: 14:00-14:15\nAuthors: Diego Arize, Mariska Kret\nAbstract: Various training applications have extensively explored emotional expressions. However, there exists a notable gap regarding the nuanced expressions encountered in everyday life especially in relation to subtle emotional cues. Such subtle emotional indicators as pupil dilation or blushing, present considerable challenges in emotion recognition, particularly for individuals with social anxiety and autism spectrum disorders who often encounter obstacles in comprehending emotions within real- world contexts. In this project, we aim to develop a tool that can teach people to recognize subtle, real- world expressions that will help them understand and trust others better. We plan to train the users on emotion processing in three steps: emotion regulation, emotion recognition, and interoception, so they can not only understand their emotions, but other people‚Äôs ones, and their reflections. It makes use of Machine Learning models that help identify users‚Äô emotional state during a training session. This tool is catered as a mobile serious game which targets a broad group of users, including patients, as they could benefit from online help as a first step to practicing social skills in a safe home environment and at their own pace. Next to the functionalities and flow, we will also present the development challenges and some preliminary results from our pilot study.\n¬†\nTitle: Virtual Reality Applications for Vulnerable People\nTime: 14:15-14:30\nAuthors: Dirk Heylen\nAbstract: In many of our studies on virtual reality and other interfaces such as robots for teaching, training and behavior change, we have often dealt with special, vulnerable groups such as young children on the autism spectrum, elderly diagnosed with Alzheimer, low-literate people with a substance addiction, or people suffering from various forms of social anxieties. Designing and researching VR applications for such groups of people poses various challenges. One can think of the design, the on-boarding, consent, the way questionnaires need to be formulated or other ways to collect data, but also other ethical aspects of data collection and the analysis. In this talk we present these challenges by illustrating them with some of the cases that we have been studying.\n¬†\nTitle: Discussion\nTime: 14:30-14:45\nAuthors: K√∂lkebeck, Katja"

Our understanding of how bi- and multilingual individuals conceptualize specific emotions (rather than generalized affect) is limited ‚Äì even though recent estimates show that more than half of the global population is bilingual. This ongoing study investigates the conceptualization of basic emotions in Polish-English bilinguals in both their languages. The conceptualizations are measured using subjective evaluations of words denoting basic emotions using common affective (valence, arousal, dominance) and cognitive (concreteness, imageability, context availability) dimensions on 9-point Likert scales. Bilingual Polish-English participants evaluate words denoting basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, joy, surprise) in Polish and in English on either the affective or the cognitive dimensions. The evaluations are compared against baseline conceptualizations from monolingual populations. Preliminary results suggest that bilinguals conceptualize basic emotions as lexicalized in Polish and in English significantly differently on the cognitive but not the affective dimensions. Furthermore, the bilinguals‚Äô conceptualizations, even those evaluated in their native Polish, differ from those of the monolingual controls. Intriguingly, these early results show that bilinguals also conceptualize emotions lexicalized as cognates (words which derive from the same lexical root and convey similar meanings in both languages) differently in Polish and in English. Combined, these results suggest that the differences in how emotions are conceptualized by bilinguals may be driven by the cognitive rather than the affective components of meaning.\n¬†\nTitle: A Contextualized Emotion Perception Assessment Relates to Well-Being: Social Interaction as a Mediator\nTime: 13:45-14:00\nAuthors: Kafetsios, Konstantinos; Hess, Ursula; Dostal, Daniel; Seitl, Martin; Sulejmanov, Filip; Hypsova, Petra; Hareli, Shlomo; Consortium, the PERWELL\nAbstract: Emotion Recognition Accuracy (ERA), the accurate assessment of others‚Äô emotional expressions and feelings, is a core human skill which is crucial for the regulation of relationships and for social functioning more generally (Fischer & Manstead, 2008; Niedenthal & Brauer, 2012). Yet, evidence documenting the social interaction consequences and well-being effects of emotion perception is sparse. In two studies we demonstrate that the Assessment of Contextualized Emotions, an ERA method that involves social context, multiple emotions and the simultaneous distinguishing between accuracy and bias is meaningfully related with well-being and social interaction quality. In an online survey across twelve cultures that utilized the ACE-short (N = 2400, ages 18-36), accuracy was associated with higher well-being (Diener et al., 2009) and life satisfaction and higher bias was associated with more loneliness. In a second, social interaction event sampling study in Germany (N = 115), that utilized the full version of the ACE, a composite index of well-being -comprising life satisfaction, Diener‚Äôs well-being measure and loneliness- was positively associated with ACE accuracy and negatively associated with ACE bias. These effects were partially mediated by social interaction quality in social and personal relationships the week preceding the well-being assessments. In both studies a standard hit rates assessment of ERA and the ACE did not unveil meaningful relationships with well-being or social interaction quality. The studies advance our understanding of ERA, and open up the possibility to pose and empirically test new questions about ERAs social functions.\n¬†\nTitle: How Ethnicity and Terminology Shape Attitudes Toward People Expressing Emotions\nTime: 14:00-14:15\nAuthors: Gonzalez, Manuel F; Cohen-Charash, Yochi\nAbstract: We examined how terminology influences attitudes toward emotions and people expressing them, and whether one‚Äôs cultural origin moderates these influences. People often label emotions as ‚Äúpositive‚Äù and ‚Äúnegative,‚Äù which, we suggest, creates value-judgments in favor of emotions described as ‚Äúpositive‚Äù and against emotions described as ‚Äúnegative,‚Äù in comparison to using other descriptive terminologies or not using such descriptive at all. We theorize that terminology shapes these value-judgments through mechanisms such as connotations (e.g., ‚Äúpositive‚Äù is a synonym for ‚Äúgood‚Äù) and priming. Furthermore, one‚Äôs cultural origin can shape (a) the meanings, associations, and connotations of words, and (b) how one perceives and understands emotions. Thus, cultural origin influences associations and connotations, and thus might moderate the influence of terminology on perception. We compared the influence of terminology on perceptions of pride (generally more valued among non-Asians) and guilt (generally more valued among Asians). An ethnically diverse sample of 185 US-based participants read definitions of pride and guilt, described as either ‚Äúpositive‚Äù/‚Äúnegative‚Äù, ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù/‚Äúunpleasant‚Äù, or using neither descriptor. We found that cultural origin (Asian/non-Asian) significantly interacted with terminology, such that Asian participants perceived proud people as more competent and warmer when pride was discussed using no terminology, relative to using ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù or ‚Äúpositive.‚Äù However, non-Asian participants‚Äô attitudes were unaffected by terminology. Terminology and cultural origin did not influence perceptions of guilt. Cultural origin may thus represent an important boundary condition for terminology‚Äôs effects on value-judgments toward emotions and those expressing them.\n¬†\nTitle: JADMEED: Multimodal Emotional Expression Database for Cross-Cultural Research and Affective Computing\nTime: 14:15-14:30\nAuthors: Tanaka, Akihiro; Takagi, Sachiko; Huis In ‚Äôt Veld, Elisabeth; de Gelder, Beatrice\nAbstract: Emotions are expressed through different sensory channels, such as a face and voice, and are perceived by integrating information from these channels in natural settings. Previous studies reported considerable cultural differences in the expression and the perception of emotion from facial and vocal channels. Recently, several databases have been developed which include both facial and vocal expressions mainly from native speakers of Western languages. However, there have been no databases which include dynamic facial and vocal expressions from multiple cultures/languages, although some include vocal stimuli from multiple languages. We introduce JADMEED (Japanese and Dutch Multimodal Emotional Expressions Database), a new audiovisual database of dynamic emotional expressions of faces and voices, which includes expressions from both East Asian (Japanese) and Western (Dutch) language speakers. JADMEED includes audiovisual movies, which are recorded from eight Japanese and eight Dutch speakers, speaking four semantically neutral short phrases with six basic emotions plus neutral. Facial and vocal expressions were separately validated by Japanese and Dutch students. Results showed that accuracies for facial expressions were above 60% except for fear in both Japanese and Dutch expressions. Although the facial and vocal expressions were recorded simultaneously, accuracies for vocal expressions were not so high as facial expressions. We expect JADMEED to be a useful open resource for researchers comparing between facial and vocal emotion perception, and those comparing unisensory and/or multisensory emotion perception between cultures in the field of psychology and neuroscience, as well as those in the field of affective computing."

Previous studies have explored parents‚Äô cardiovascular reactions to children‚Äôs vocalized expressions of emotions, but little is known about their responses to children‚Äôs facial expressions of emotions. This study aimed to determine if viewing facial expressions of emotions in children induces cardiovascular changes in mothers, and whether this differs based on childhood maltreatment. A total of 79 mothers were recruited from community organizations that provide services to vulnerable families and from the university. Childhood maltreatment experiences were measured using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Participants underwent a task during which they viewed a landscape video as a baseline, and images of children‚Äôs faces displaying various emotions. Electrocardiogram signals were recorded, and heart rate variability (HRV) was used as an indicator of parasympathetic reactivity. Two distinct physiological profiles were observed in mothers: increased or decreased HRV in response to children‚Äôs facial expressions of emotions. Mothers who had experienced childhood emotional abuse were more likely to exhibit an increased HRV when watching children‚Äôs emotional facial expressions, which could indicate lower levels of behavioral engagement. Physiological dysregulation caused by childhood maltreatment may pose a risk for maladaptive parenting behaviors. This study emphasizes the importance of providing targeted interventions to help parents, particularly those with histories of childhood maltreatment, manage their physiological and behavioral responses to facial expressions of emotions in children.\n¬†\nTitle: The Role of Emotion Recognition and Alexithymia on the Relationship Between a History of Maltreatment and Parental Sensitivity.\nTime: 13:45-14:00\nAuthors: Martel, Marguerite; B√©rub√©, Annie\nAbstract: Child maltreatment is a global crisis, with estimates indicating that nearly 1 billion children under the age of 17 experienced abuse and neglect within the past year (World Health Organization, 2022). Research indicates that a parent with a history of maltreatment is more likely to be less sensitive to their child‚Äôs needs (Savage et al., 2019). Moreover, maltreatment can lead to difficulties for children in understanding, perceiving, and interpreting emotions (Pollak, 2012). These difficulties can be present in adulthood, resulting in alexithymia (Assed et al., 2020; Ditzer et al., 2023). Although current research allows us to understand that alexithymia is related to difficulties in recognizing emotions in others, few studies have specifically investigated this relationship while considering the influence of maltreatment and the repercussions of these interactions on parental sensitivity. Furthermore, few studies have specifically focused on the recognition of emotions in children‚Äôs faces. This research aims to examine how maltreatment is related to parental sensitivity and how this relationship is influenced by alexithymia and emotion recognition. The sample consists of 60 dyads composed of a child aged between 2 and a half and 5 years and their parent recruited in community organizations, at the university, and on social media in the province of Quebec, Canada. Maltreatment experienced by the parent was measured using the short French version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Paquette et al., 2004). Alexithymia was measured using the French version of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) (Bagby et al., 2020). Emotion recognition was assessed through a recognition task involving images displaying the six fundamental emotions on the faces of two Caucasian children. Images were generated using FantaMorph software‚Äôs morphing technique. Accuracy scores were derived from that task. Finally, parental sensitivity was measured by coding a 15-minute interaction between parent and child according to Feldman‚Äôs grid (1998). A moderated-moderation analysis indicated that parental sensitivity is predicted by the interaction between alexithymia, emotion recognition, and history of maltreatment (Hayes, 2022). The nature of the interaction was interpreted with simple slope tests analysis. Results indicate that for mothers with average or good emotion recognition abilities and no symptoms of alexithymia, parental sensitivity decreases as the history of maltreatment increases in severity. However, for mothers with alexithymia, no matter the ability to recognize emotions in children faces, the relationship between a history of maltreatment and parental sensitivity remains low. This research offers a more in-depth understanding of the factors involved in the challenges related to dealing with children emotions for parents with a history of maltreatment. It offers a new understanding of the intergenerational cycle of maltreatment.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotions in Sync?: Children and Adults‚Äô Cooperation and Interpersonal Liking During Face-to-Face Interactions\nTime: 14:00-14:15\nAuthors: Riddell, Christopher; Nikolic, Milica; van Bockstaele, Bram; Kret, Mariska\nAbstract: Previous research in adults has linked synchrony (of both emotional facial expressions and physiological signals) during live interactions to increased cooperation and interpersonal liking. However, the extent to which synchrony influences children‚Äôs cooperative behaviour and liking, and whether this differs from adults, is currently unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of the synchrony of both emotional facial expressions and physiological activity (skin conductance level, heart rate variability and blush) on cooperation and liking. Dyads of N = 240 children and N = 214 adults participated in a real-life Prisoner‚Äôs dilemma game with an unfamiliar interaction partner and completed a questionnaire on interpersonal liking. As of the time of submission, we have analysed the smile and skin conductance level data and will perform the rest of the analyses before the conference date. We found that adults synchronised their smiles and skin conductance level significantly above chance, whereas children did not. Notably, neither synchrony in smiles nor skin conductance level predicted cooperation across both age groups, although the gender composition of the dyad emerged as a significant predictor in children. In adults, but not in children, the synchrony of smiles predicted greater interpersonal liking. The results of this work may suggest that the positive adaptive function of synchrony in naturalistic emotional interactions may be more complex than previous lab-based studies suggest.\n¬†\nTitle: Profiles of Parental Intra- And Interpersonal Emotion Regulation in Academic Contexts\nTime: 14:15-14:30\nAuthors: Jordan, Gesine; Greiff, Samuel ; Teuber, Ziwen\nAbstract: Parenting is an emotion-eliciting experience, especially when it comes to the offspring‚Äôs educational paths. Parents‚Äô emotional characteristics pertain their habitual use of emotion regulation (ER) strategies to regulate their own and their children‚Äôs emotions. Strong evidence suggests that parental ER crucially impacts their children‚Äôs ER and adjustment. However, patterns of parents‚Äô intra- and interpersonal ER remain unexplored to date. Moreover, parents‚Äô ER impacts their stress responses and wellbeing, e.g., parental burnout. To tackle these gaps in the literature, we investigated profiles of parents‚Äô intra- and interpersonal ER. Our preregistered 3-wave study targets US parents of 6-9 graders. Current analyses were based on wave1 of the data collection and will be extended once all waves are completed (May 2024). The sample consisted of 1110 US parents, recruited via Prolific and balanced on gender. To test the research questions, we employed Latent profile analyses which revealed five profiles of parental intra- and interpersonal ER strategies. We could identify one profile using rather adaptive and another rather maladaptive intra- and interpersonal ER strategies. Two profiles showed low intensity for all ER strategies, alongside a distinct profile demonstrating lower usage of intrapersonal and strong usage of interpersonal ER strategies. After the completed data collection, we will explore the stability of the profiles, predictors (socioeconomic variables) and outcomes (parental burnout, adolescences academic adjustment). Conclusions from the study have the potential to provide deeper insights into the complex emotional processes and consequences of parenting, specifically regarding academic contexts.\n¬†\nTitle: Investigating Child-Parent Emotional Discourse and Emotion Recognition Through Interactive Experiments\nTime: 14:30-14:45\nAuthors: Varatharaj, Ashvini; Brehm, Laurel\nAbstract: Emotion socialization, the process by which caregivers influence children‚Äôs understanding, expression, and regulation of emotions, is crucial for psychological development (Eisenberg et al.¬†1998). Successful emotion expression is linked to reduced risk of psychopathologies in children (Chaplin and Cole 2005). This study explores the dynamics of emotion-related conversations between children and their parents, shedding light on the acquisition of adult-like emotional language and understanding in children. We designed interactive experiments hosted at a local children‚Äôs museum to elicit parent-child emotion-related conversations and analyzed these using a mixed methods approach. One component involved children using puppets to enact and explain emotions, followed by parents interpreting these emotions. This method offers unique insights into children‚Äôs conceptualization of emotions and parents‚Äô perspectives on their emotional understanding. Additionally, we introduced scenarios, through vignettes and an AI-generated interface in ChatGPT-4 where children guessed the emotions of characters being simulated by ChatGPT-4 by asking questions, allowing us to discern their ability to recognize emotions in others and themselves. Their interactions with ChatGPT-4, especially the questions they ask and their emotional guesses, unveil their underlying emotional concepts. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of emotion socialization and its implications for children‚Äôs mental health through a linguistics lens. This study‚Äôs innovative approach, blending traditional methods with AI-assisted interaction, marks a step forward in emotion research, particularly in understanding the interplay of language and emotion in child development."

To clarify the mechanisms of reappraisal, we investigated whether appraisal shifts, or changes in cognitive evaluations of a situation, predict changes in affective experience. In an online study, 158 participants (75 men; mean age 27.66 years, SD = 8.06; Prolific Academic) rated their affective experience and reported their appraisals while viewing and reappraising negative, neutral, and positive images. An ongoing laboratory replication (N = 70) also incorporates electroencephalographic and electromyographic measures as objective markers of affective experience. Linear mixed models showed that in the online study, reappraisal with the goal to increase positive emotions enhanced subjective positive affect but also reduced subjective negative affect in all three valence contexts (p‚Äôs &lt; .001). Linear regression models revealed that appraisal shifts predicted changes in affective experience, but different appraisal dimensions were significant predictors depending on the valence context. For example, reappraisal-related increase in subjective positive affect was predicted by changes in congruence (Œ≤ = .45, p &lt; .001) and outlook congruence (Œ≤ = .31, p &lt; .001) in the negative context, but changes in certainty in the neutral context (Œ≤ = .38, p &lt; .001). These results suggest that appraisal shifts provide a useful framework for understanding the psychological mechanisms of reappraisal, and that these mechanisms may vary depending on the valence context.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotion Crafting: Individuals as Agents of their Positive Emotional Experiences\nTime: 13:45-14:00\nAuthors: Van der Kaap-Deeder, Jolene\nAbstract: Emotion regulation (ER) ‚Äì the processes individuals use to determine which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience or express them ‚Äì is one of the key determinants of well-being. Most of the extant research has focused on how people reactively engage in regulatory processes in response to specific emotional events, thereby focusing mostly on negative emotions. However, individuals not only respond to (anticipated) emotion-loaded stimuli but can also actively and purposely initiate and direct their emotional experiences. Recently, it has been proposed that ER can occur either prior (proactive ER) or after (reactive ER) the onset of an emotional stimulus. Similarly, Self-Determination Theory maintains that individuals have the innate need to be the authors of their own lives‚Äîthe ones who proactively and autonomously shape their functioning and life circumstances. Despite these theoretical considerations and the vast literature on emotion regulation, little is known about the proactive regulation of positive emotions. In this talk, I will highlight the importance of positive emotions and the role of agency in the domain of emotion regulation by introducing the concept of emotion crafting. Emotion crafting indicates the degree to which individuals are aware of positive emotion-inducing contexts (awareness) and proactively act upon this awareness (action) to increase their positive emotions. Recent research will be presented on the validation of the Emotion Crafting Scale and on how emotion crafting relates to key indicators of individuals‚Äô psychological functioning.\n¬†\nTitle: Bi-Directional Associations Between Social Sharing and Emotion Differentiation in Everyday Life\nTime: 14:00-14:15\nAuthors: Sels, Laura; Erbas, Yasemin I; O‚ÄôBrien, Sarah; Verhofstadt, Lesley; Clark, Margaret; Kalokerinos, Elise\nAbstract: Laypeople believe that sharing their emotional experiences with others will improve their understanding of those experiences, but no clear empirical evidence supports this belief. To address this gap, we used data from four daily life studies (N total = 659) with student and community samples to explore the association between social sharing and subsequent emotion differentiation (labelling emotions with a high degree of complexity) and vice versa. We found that when people experienced specific, stressful negative events and did not ruminate about them, social sharing was linked to greater subsequent emotion differentiation. In contrast, when people experienced such events and ruminated about them, social sharing was linked to lower emotion differentiation. Additionally, this relationship was reciprocal: lower emotion differentiation was linked to greater subsequent social sharing.\n¬†\nTitle: Suppressed Pleasure: Reinstating Pleasantness as a Causal Antecedent of Interest\nTime: 14:15-14:30\nAuthors: Zhou, Haotian; Wang, Chao; Li, Ziqian; Yang, Yu\nAbstract: The current article reexamines the debate between Smith and Ellsworth‚Äôs classic model (SE Model; Smith & Ellsworth, 1985) and Silvia‚Äôs model (2005) on the appraisal structure of interest as an emotion. The SE Model suggests that perceiving an event as pleasant is essential for experiencing interest, while Silvia‚Äôs model argues that interest can arise independently of pleasantness. This research critically assesses Turner and Silvia‚Äôs (2006) study (TS experiment), which supported Silvia‚Äôs perspective but is potentially flawed methodologically. We first identified a significant methodological limitation in the TS experiment. Despite this, our two exact replications of the TS experiment, intentionally preserving the identified flaw, replicated the original study‚Äôs null finding, seemingly discrediting the SE Model‚Äôs stance on pleasantness. However, when applying appropriate statistical controls, our analysis of the very same data suggested evidence in favour of the SE Model. Further, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation demonstrating that the TS experiment had less than a 33% chance of detecting a causal relationship between pleasantness and interest, even if one exists. Extending our inquiry, we employed computational linguistics and natural language processing techniques in two novel studies. Study 4 utilized word embeddings to show that the positivity of a word is positively correlated with its proximity to interest-related words. Study 5 leveraged deep neural networks to analyse natural language statements, revealing a consistent association of interest with pleasant experiences. These findings collectively challenge the TS experiment‚Äôs conclusions and provide support for the SE Model, suggesting a positive relationship between pleasantness and interest.\n¬†\nTitle: The Paradox of Dampening Positive Emotions: Depressive Symptoms Explain Strategy Choice in Positive Emotional Contexts\nTime: 14:30-14:45\nAuthors: Mueller, Ilka; Pruessner, Luise; Holt, Daniel V.; Zimmermann, Verena; Schulze, Katrin; Strakosch, Ana-Maria; Barnow, Sven\nAbstract: Although most people aim to enhance their positive emotions, some employ strategies that have been associated with a dampening of pleasurable emotional experiences. Unfavorable strategy choice in positive emotional contexts might occur especially in depressive disorders, characterized by anhedonia. This ecological momentary assessment study investigated a) how effective different emotion regulation strategies are to regulate positive emotions and b) how the severity of depressive symptoms predicts their selection. We analyzed data from 1,066 participants who a) completed the Beck-Depression-Inventory-II at baseline and b) were notified five times daily for seven consecutive days to complete a smartphone survey assessing their predominant emotions, strategies to regulate them, and emotional outcomes. Findings show that strategies effective in handling negative emotions, namely reappraisal and problem-solving, were associated with deteriorated emotional outcomes when used to regulate positive emotions. In contrast, strategies such as acceptance and savoring were more effective when regulating positive emotions. Importantly, people with more severe depressive symptoms were more likely to use strategies linked to the dampening of positive emotional experiences and less prone to choose strategies to effectively up-regulate positive emotions. Our findings emphasize the importance of deficits in the selection of strategies to regulate positive emotions for our understanding of the etiology and maintenance of depression. Thus, context-specific interventions to enhance positive emotion regulation may be a promising approach to improve the treatment of affective disorders. Further studies should address the underlying processes, such as emotional beliefs, that drive this maladaptive strategy choice."

We trained diverse Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on three databases: FER-2013, RAF-DB, and AffectNet, each annotated based on Ekman‚Äôs theory of seven discrete emotions. Our comparative analysis of similar CNN models reveals significant inconsistencies in annotations, especially within AffectNet. This variability, coupled with limitations of Ekman‚Äôs theory, underscores the challenge for AI systems in accurately capturing the complexity of human emotions through facial behavior. Current research relies predominantly on Deep Learning (DL), often overlooking fundamental issues and instead focusing on developing increasingly complex DL models. Such models use multi-layered interconnected nodes (similar to neurons) to process large amounts of data. While DL has achieved significant success, its increasing architectural complexity leads to a lack of explainability and reliability. DL models depend on large datasets annotated with theoretical concepts that may lack robust scientific validation. To address these intertwined challenges, we propose combining advanced DL models with traditional Symbolic AI, known for its logical reasoning and symbolic knowledge representation. This synthesis forms Neuro-Symbolic AI, an area of AI research gaining increasing interest. We consider this area as a pathway to establish a bidirectional mapping between knowledge (graphs) encoded in a trained DL model, and knowledge representations, such as FACS, grounded in emotion psychology. This enhances explainability and reliability of DL, while moving beyond discrete facial emotion recognition to a more nuanced analysis of facial behavior of emotions. This progress is key to emotionally intelligent human-computer interaction.\n¬†\nTitle: Return of a Gold Standard: Electromyography-Based Facial Action Unit Recognition\nTime: 13:45-14:00\nAuthors: K√ºster, Dennis; Veldanda, Abhinav; Liu, Hui; Krumhuber, Eva; Koschke, Rainer; Schultz, Tanja\nAbstract: For decades, facial Electromyography (EMG) and the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) were regarded as laboratory gold standards in emotion research. Where the former featured supreme temporal resolution and sensitivity for otherwise invisible muscle responses, the latter offered a comprehensive expert-based coding of facial muscle activity. Meanwhile, automated action unit recognition (AUR) has revolutionized video-based FACS-coding. In contrast, few studies to date have explored how action units (AUs) could be classified from EMG instead of video data. We present a proof-of-concept study with one subject imitating four AUs (AU1, AU2, AU4, AU9) and concurrent bi-polar EMG recordings from the Corrugator Supercilii and lateral Frontalis sites. Using five-fold cross-validation, four out of six widely used machine- and deep learning models achieved near perfect AUR accuracies (&gt;.95) based on data from both EMG channels. A random forest model outperformed the other models using single-channel data, as well as in an initial near real-time test of our AUR system. Presently, we are collecting data for a second study targeting a sample of 20 lay participants, eight AUs, four EMG recording sites, with validation data for peak images via manual expert FACS-coding. Based on these preliminary results, EMG-based AUR systems might soon be able to compete with, if not outperform, current camera-based approaches. Illustrated by new use-cases in virtual reality, real-time interaction with embodied conversational agents, or privacy-sensitive measurement, we discuss how recent advances could lead to a renaissance of EMG in emotion research.\n¬†\nTitle: Electrophysiological Correlates of Intensity and Dynamic Information in Emotional Facial Expression Recognition\nTime: 14:00-14:15\nAuthors: Palazova, Marina; M√ºckstein, Marie; St√ºrmer, Birgit\nAbstract: Most research on emotion recognition from facial expressions has utilized static pictures showing the apex of the emotional display. Recent evidence suggests that the intensity of emotional facial expressions as well as dynamic information modulate emotion processing. However, both factors have not been studied simultaneously yet. In the present study we seek to replicate intensity and dynamic information effects on emotion recognition and examine basic aspects of both factors simultaneously while recording the EEG. Participants (n = 105) performed an emotion categorization task on static and dynamic images of four facial expressions (anger, fear, happiness and neutral) in two intensities (60% and 100 %). Emotion recognition was modulated by both, intensity and dynamic information. In event-related brain potentials, effects of intensity were first evident in the EPN component whereas effects of dynamic presentation started earlier with the P1 component. While emotion effects in the N170 were reduced in the dynamic condition, dynamic presentation augmented emotion effects in the EPN, specifically for the 60 % intensity condition. Such a visual processing boost compared with static expressions might explain why dynamic facial expressions are often rated to be more intense than static facial expressions. Since in everyday life emotional expressions are genuinely dynamic, more subtle, and strongly controlled than static images used in laboratory conditions, the study of less intense dynamic facial expressions might increase ecological validity. Further, the large sample delivers a strong basis for examining individual differences in emotion recognition. ps: a talk would be preferred.\n¬†\nTitle: A Walk in the Park: Measuring Emotional Mimicry with Electromyography in Virtual Reality\nTime: 14:15-14:30\nAuthors: Kastendieck, Till; Huppertz, Daniel; Mauersberger, Heidi; Hess, Ursula\nAbstract: Research on contextualized approaches to emotion and emotion communication, including the automatic but goal-dependent imitation of the interaction partner‚Äôs emotional expressions, known as emotional mimicry, has made remarkable progress over the years. An important aspect of context is situational and spatial embeddedness, emphasizing that the affective fit of faces and places influences mimicry. However, emotional mimicry has never been studied in highly immersive virtual reality surroundings. In a laboratory experiment, 75 participants wore head-mounted displays with integrated electromyography (EMG) sensors that measured the corrugator supercilii (associated with a negative affect), orbicularis oculi, zygomaticus major (positive affect), as well as frontalis. In line with emotional mimicry in social context theory (Hess & Fischer) and broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson), participants mimicked joyful expressions in pleasant audio-visual contexts (park area with greenery, bird song) more than in unpleasant contexts (park area with construction site, loud construction site noise), as shown by linear mixed modeling. In line with predictions of the former theory, according to a multilevel mediation model, emotion perception and perceived interpersonal closeness (i.e., self-other overlap, inclusion of other in the self) were negatively associated with the change from pleasant to unpleasant contexts and positively associated with joy mimicry. Moreover, unpleasant contexts intensified reactions to distressed faces but only at an earlier stage of the expression episode. The findings are the first to provide EMG evidence gathered in virtual reality on emotional mimicry, supporting accounts that highlight the embedded nature of emotion communication and strengthening top-down perspectives on this important social regulator.\n¬†\nTitle: Does Distraction Foster Subsequent Reappraisal? an EMG and EEG Investigation into Strategy Sequencing\nTime: 14:30-14:45\nAuthors: Uusberg, Helen; Kolnes, Martin MK\nAbstract: Reappraisal is a widely studied and generally effective as well as adaptive emotion regulation strategy. However, it has been shown to be used less frequently and to work less effectively than distraction in situations characterized by high emotional intensity. This suggests that it might be advantageous to use distraction and reappraisal in a sequence to first lower the intensity of an emotion and then leverage the adaptiveness of reappraisal. To test the hypothesis that distraction fosters subsequent reappraisal in downregulating high intensity negative affect, we conducted a laboratory experiment where 67 participants (mean age 26.11 years, SD = 10.54) were presented with neutral, low intensity negative, and high intensity negative images and instructed to use different combinations of the following instructions: view, distraction, and reappraisal. Simultaneously, we recorded participants‚Äô electroencephalography (EEG) and facial electromyography (EMG). The results showed that initial distraction did not improve the effect of subsequent reappraisal. Instead, reappraisal reduced negative affect in response to high intensity negative images more effectively when participants initially simply viewed the images, as indexed by corrugator supercilii activity. The LPP amplitude during subsequent reappraisal was decreased when participants first implemented distraction; however, this effect was limited to very early latencies (approximately 260-450 ms), indicating altered stimulus recognition. The discrepancy between EMG and LPP dynamics points to methodological challenges when using laboratory experiments incorporating pictorial stimuli and LPP measurement to study the effects of strategy sequencing. I will discuss these challenges in light of other methodologically similar studies from our group and beyond."

The way we respond emotionally is frequently influenced by the interpersonal setting, such as engaging in emotional discussions or experiencing interpersonal emotion regulation. These emotional reactions, in turn, play a role in shaping the relationship and our sentiments towards it; for instance, sharing moments of joy can foster a sense of closeness between individuals. This symposium examines the complex interplay between emotions and interpersonal relationships using diverse methodologies. The first talk employs linguistic analysis of conversations between strangers to learn how conversational structure relates to changes in positive affect. The second presentation examines how different interpersonal emotion regulation strategies are linked to social-emotional outcomes for the regulator using questionnaires and task-based assessments. The third talk presents two ecological momentary assessment studies examining the effectiveness of different interpersonal emotion regulation strategies in everyday life and shows the advantage of strategies that focus on relational aspects (vs. those that do not). The fourth presentation uses a dyadic daily diary to examine how parents‚Äö√Ñ√¥ and adolescents‚Äö√Ñ√¥ interpersonal emotion regulation relates to how regulator and regulatee perceive their relationship partners as responsive. The fifth talk employs five waves of a dyadic ecological momentary assessment to show the bi-directional, within-dyad associations between maternal attunement and negative and positive emotions. The current symposium will advance our understanding of how interpersonal emotion regulation can contribute to healthier relationships and how fostering healthier and more resilient connections across various relationship types contributes to emotional well-being.\n\n\nTitle: Shaping Others‚Äô Emotions in Conversation: An Analysis of Temporal Dynamics\nTime: 15:15-15:30\nAuthors: Haran Sened\nAbstract: Conversations are a powerful way for people to shape others‚Äô emotions. Simply through speak- ing, one person can shift another person‚Äôs internal emotion state. What is it about one person‚Äôs words that can make another feel better? Prior work shows that paralinguistic characteristics, such as the length of each speech turn, and semantic characteristics, such as similarity in emotional content, are associatedwith better conversation outcomes. The current study ex- amines whether these characteristics are associated with better outcomes uniformly across the conversation or whether their importance changes over time. We analyzed 400 transcripts of 30-minute online conversations between strangers. We measured speech turn length by counting characters and emotional similarity using a word embedding model. Analyses exam- ined how changes in these characteristics over time are associatedwith emotional change ‚Äì defined as increased positive emotions from before to after the conversation. Results revealed that conversations have a reliable temporal dynamic. Speech turns grew longer fromthe begin- ning to the middle of conversations, and then started to decline (i.e., a quadratic effect for time). Emotional similarity showed a similar n-shaped dynamic. The conversations with the most exaggerated n-shapes showed more positive emotional change. Our findings suggest that people startconversations by converging to a similar emotional state. They then explore a wider emotional space, with more extensive turns, a process that leads to positive emotional change. This work suggests thatattempts at interpersonal emotional regulation, in which peo- ple aim for emotional change intentionally, might be more effective if they follow these patterns.

Speech turns grew longer fromthe begin- ning to the middle of conversations, and then started to decline (i.e., a quadratic effect for time). Emotional similarity showed a similar n-shaped dynamic. The conversations with the most exaggerated n-shapes showed more positive emotional change. Our findings suggest that people startconversations by converging to a similar emotional state. They then explore a wider emotional space, with more extensive turns, a process that leads to positive emotional change. This work suggests thatattempts at interpersonal emotional regulation, in which peo- ple aim for emotional change intentionally, might be more effective if they follow these patterns.\n¬†\nTitle: Distraction over Reappraisal Strategies in Interpersonal Emotion Regulation: Associations with Socio-Emotional Difficulties\nTime: 15:30-15:45\nAuthors: Belen Lopez-Perez\nAbstract: When aiming to change the emotions of others, not all strategies might be equally beneficial. While some may elaborate on the target‚Äôs emotional response (engagement), others may not address the emotional needs (diversion). Distraction (as a diversion strategy) has been sug- gested as less effective than reappraisal (engagement) to regulate emotions. We argue that if it is less effective, the predominant use of distraction over reappraisal to change others‚Äô emo- tions might be problematic. To evaluate this, we conducted three studies in which we assessed people‚Äôs tendency to use distraction over reappraisal through questionnaires (Studies 1 and 2) and through different scenarios describing the target as experiencing different emotions (Study 3). In detail, in Study 1 (n = 274) and Study 2 (n = 202), we used a difference score to assess individuals‚Äô dominant use of distraction over reappraisal. The tendency to use distrac- tion over reappraisal to change others‚Äô emotions was linked to more difficulties in identifying and describing feelings and greater experience of personal distress (Study 1) and to more emotion dysregulation and socio-emotional problems (Study 2). In Study 3 (n = 121), based on latent class analysis, we identified a class of people who consistently used distraction to change others‚Äô anger, sadness, and anxiety over engagement strategies. Importantly, this class scored higher in difficulties at identifying and describing feelings and experiential avoid- ance. The obtained results suggest that the consistent use of diversion over engagement strat- egies to change others‚Äô emotions might be associated with more socio-emotional difficulties in the regulator.\n¬†\nTitle: Dealing with Other People‚Äôs Feelings: Effectiveness of Extrinsic Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Strategies in Everyday Life\nTime: 15:45-16:00\nAuthors: Luise Pruessner\nAbstract: While we can effectively alter our own emotional states by employing strategies like cognitive reappraisal, distraction, or problem-solving, it remains unclear if these approaches can be suc- cessfully extended to regulating the emotions of those around us. Existing emotion regulation research has primarily focused on examining the success of intrinsic, self-focused strategies, leaving a gap in our understanding of the effectiveness of extrinsic, other-focused emotion regulation strategies. Therefore, we conducted two ecological momentary assessment studies (Ns = 131 and 204) testing the effectiveness of extrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation strat- egies for achieving other-focused regulatory goals in daily social interactions from the regula- tor‚Äôs perspective. We examined a comprehensive set of 15 extrinsic regulatory strategies rep- resenting all stages of the emotion regulation process (situation selection and modification, attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation). Remarkably, our find- ings from both studies revealed that strategies considered effective for managing one‚Äôs own emotions, such as reappraisal, distraction, and problem-solving, were perceived as ineffective when applied with the goal of influencing the affective states of others. In contrast, the regula- tors reported that validation, soothing, or affectionate touch were linked to higher levels of mod- ulating their interaction partner‚Äôs emotions as intended. These findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between self-focused and other focused emotion regulation goals when ex- amining the effectiveness of regulatory strategies. Understanding how to successfully modu- late the emotions of those we interact with is fundamental for fostering healthier relationships and enhancing the emotional well-being of ourselves and the people around us.\n¬†\nTitle: Interpersonal Emotion Regulation is Associated with Parents‚Äô and Adolescents‚Äô Perceived Partner Responsiveness\nTime: 16:00-16:15\nAuthors: Reuma Gadassi Polack\nAbstract: The way in which parents respond to their children‚Äôs emotions (interpersonal emotion regula- tion; IER) is important for child social-emotional development and well-being. However, it is less known how IER is associated with outcomes to the parent-child relationship (e.g., perceived responsiveness). Additionally, only a handful of studies examined children‚Äôs IER of their par- ents. We address these gaps by examining parent and adolescent IER and perceived partner responsiveness using the Actor Partner Interdependence Model. For 28 days, 112 parent-ad- olescent (age 12-18) dyads completed a dyadic diary, reporting their IER to dyad members‚Äô negative and positive emotions as well as the degree to which they perceive their partner as responsive. Results show that on days in which parents used IER to improve their children‚Äôs positive or negative affect, both they and adolescents perceived the other as more responsive. Similarly, on days in which adolescents used IER to improve their parents‚Äô positive or negative affect, both they and their parents perceived the other as more responsive. Conversely, on days in which parents or children used IER to make their dyad partner‚Äôs affect worse, the regulator perceived their partner as less responsive. When adolescents tried to make their parents pos- itive affect decrease, parents perceived their child as less responsive. Similarly, on days par- ents tried to increase their children‚Äôs negative affect, adolescents perceived them as less re- sponsive. These results demonstrate that perceiving dyad members as responsive is related, in addition to the partner‚Äôs behaviors, to how you behave towards your partner.\n¬†\nTitle: What Benefits Do Mothers Gain from Maternal Attunement? a Five-Wave Dyadic Study Across Preadolescence\nTime: 16:15-16:30\nAuthors: Reout Arbel\nAbstract: This study explored what affective benefits (if any) mothers gain by being attuned to a pread- olescent child and, in turn, whether these benefits help mothers maintain attuned caring. We used a six-wave longitudinal investigation to test the bi-directional temporal associations be- tween child-reported maternal attunement and mothers‚Äô self-reported well-being, including mood and self-esteem. Our sample included 202 ethnically diverse mother [Mage at baseline = 40.1 years (SD = 6.1)] and child [Mage at baseline=10.1 (SD = .90), 51% girls] dyads. We used five 7-day waves of Ecological Momentary Assessment, with each wave separated by 6 months. Up to eight random times per day, mothers reported on two state-level positive emo- tions (PE; happy, calm/relaxed) and three negative emotions(NE; angry, sad, stressed). We used a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) to test within- and between- person effects. At the within-person level, increased NE was negatively associated with ma- ternal attunement within the same wave, and increased attunement on a given wave predicted mothers‚Äô decreased negative emotions on the next. Same-wave or across-wave associations with PE or perceived stress were weak and non-significant. At the between-person level, av- erage levels of maternal attunement did not significantly correlate with average levels of PE or NE or with perceived stress. Results suggest that increased sensitive care for an adolescent child is associated with less distress for mothers. This suggests a reinforcing mechanism of maternal sensitive caring. Results were largely unchanged when we controlled for child sex, maternal global perceived stress, and mothers‚Äô reported child internalized or externalized prob- lems."

The first talk will discuss peripheral nerve fiber evidence that implicates C-tactile (CT) and A≈í‚â§ afferents in signaling touch-related information. Through ERPs and EEG oscillations, forearm stroking stimuli have been examined, revealing differential neural responses linked to various stroking velocities. The sN400 ERP component mirrored CT and A≈í‚â§ afferent firing patterns, showing associations with individual touch preferences, indicating biases towards implicit and explicit processes influenced by these afferents. The second talk will discuss affiliative touch's role in stress modulation and emotional well-being highlighting cutaneous low-threshold mechanoreceptors (CLTMs) as potential regulators of stress resilience. These receptors, sensitive to gentle, dynamic touch, project to emotion-processing brain regions, proposing them as a vital substrate for emotional regulation‚Äö√Ñ√Æa concept termed 'Vitamin-T,' emphasizing the importance of touch to emotional as well as physical health. The third talk will examine insights from psilocybin's effects on individuals with depression and will discuss a potential therapeutic avenue, indicating improved emotional attitudes towards social touch post-administration. This suggests a mechanism through which psilocybin may alleviate depressive symptoms by positively influencing social touch perceptions. The final talk will delve into oxytocin's modulation during affiliative touch-mediated interactions highlight its context-dependent neural regulation, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between brain-hormone co-modulation and social touch in shaping relational dynamics. These studies collectively illuminate tactile perception's neural intricacies, stress modulation, and therapeutic implications, showcasing the nuanced interplay between tactile experiences, neural mechanisms, and emotional well-being.\n\n\nTitle: EEG Insights into the Neural Construction of Tactile Affect\nTime: 15:15-15:30\nAuthors: Annett Schirmer\nAbstract: Evidence from peripheral nerve fibers suggests that the pleasantness of a caress depends on the activation of C-tactile (CT) and AŒ≤ afferents in the skin and their signaling input to the brain. Yet, how this input is processed and integrated with other brain mechanisms to inform the implicit and explicit value of touch is currently unknown. We pursued this issue by examining both event-related potentials (ERPs) and EEG oscillations to slow stroking stimuli delivered via a soft brush to the forearm. The stimuli varied in velocity and were rated on a pleasantness scale. Stroking elicited a negative ERP component around 400 ms following touch onset over contra-lateral somatosensory cortex. This sN400 was larger for intermediate when compared with slower and faster velocities reminiscent of the firing pattern of CT afferents. Additionally, faster velocities dampened somatosensory Rolandic rhythms in line with the known firing pattern of AŒ≤ afferents. sN400 amplitude and Rolandic rhythms predicted pleasantness ratings in different ways. The sN400 association showed irrespective of whether participants preferred fast or slow touch. However, the Rolandic rhythm association revealed individual differences. In those preferring fast touch, Rolandic rhythms differentiated between fast velocities, whereas in those preferring slow touch, these rhythms differentiated between slow velocities. Based on these results, we speculate that sN400 and Rolandic rhythms are differently shaped by CT and AŒ≤ input. Moreover, although both afferents contribute to tactile affect their contributions may be biased towards implicit and explicit processes, respectively.\n¬†\nTitle: Vitamin T\nTime: 15:30-15:45\nAuthors: Francis McGlone\nAbstract: Chronic stress is the cause of many adverse changes in the brain and has also been found to be an antecedent of mood changes associated with cognitive impairment. Affiliative tactile interactions are known to buffer social mammals against neurobiological and behavioural effects of stress, and within human populations the recent COVID pandemic, where for the first time in human evolution affective touch interactions were significantly restricted, we saw the adverse consequences on people‚Äôs stress levels and subsequent emotional state. But what‚Äôs the mechanism? Here a case will be made for the role of a population of cutaneous low threshold thermo- mechanosensitive c-fibres called c-low threshold mechanoreceptors (CLTM) as a neurobiological substrate responsible for regulating resilience to stress. Due to the delayed nature of their input, they cannot serve any useful discriminative role and are implicated in underpinning the affective and emotional aspects of touch. CLTMs are velocity tuned, preferentially encoding gentle, dynamic touch and project centrally to emotion processing brain areas. The CLTM is now being understood to provide a singular vital protective function, from the nurturing touch of the mother to its absence in loneliness. And now we have evidence from animal studies of their putative role in reducing plaque formation. A case will be made for what we are describing, by analogy with the vital role vitamins play in our physical health, for affective touch and their neuronal substrate the CLTM as ‚ÄòVitamin-T‚Äô for our emotional health.\n¬†\nTitle: The Effects of Psilocybin (‚Äòmagic Mushrooms‚Äô) on Social Touch Perception in Individuals with Resistant Major Depressive Disorder\nTime: 15:45-16:00\nAuthors: Leehe Peled-Avron\nAbstract: Individuals with depression often experience difficulties in social interactions. Social interactions consist of both verbal and non-verbal means of communication, among which is social touch which is used to convey several types of emotions. Depression is associated with negative attitudes towards social touch and these negative attitudes mediate interpersonal difficulties. Psilocybin, the active compound in several types of fungi (‚Äòmagic mushrooms‚Äô) has been shown to alleviate symptoms of depression. Yet its effects on social interaction and specifically on social touch have yet to be explored. In this study, we examined the effect of psilocybin administration on perception of social touch in individuals with resistant major depressive disorder. Participants watch photos of either humans or inanimate objects touching or not. Participants are then asked to rate their emotions towards the objects in the photos. The responses are recorded a week before and a week after administration of 25mg of synthetic psilocybin during psychedelic assisted psychotherapy. Results demonstrate a significant increase in emotionality ratings in the human touch condition after psilocybin administration, no such difference was found for the ratings of the control conditions or following placebo administration. These results point to a potential improvement of the attitudes towards social touch following a psychedelic intervention in depression and may suggest a possible mechanism through which psilocybin alleviates depressive symptoms.\n¬†\nTitle: The Neuroscience of Human Social Touch\nTime: 16:00-16:15\nAuthors: India Morisson\nAbstract: Our knowledge of the neural underpinnings of affective touch has burgeoned over the past two decades, on levels from the receptor to larger-scale functional neuroanatomy of the brain. Yet we still understand very little about how these mechanisms might contribute to the role of touch in human social interaction. This talk describes ways in which specific properties of touch can be organized by the human nervous system during affiliative social interactions. In particular, our recent investigations of co-modulation between the brain and the neuropeptide oxytocin have suggested that oxytocin neuromodulation during touch-mediated social interactions is flexible and context-dependent. In humans, parietotemporal brain pathways may play a selective role in these context-sensitive processes, potentially allowing ‚Äútuning‚Äù of brain and body responses during social interactions. Such brain-hormone co-modulation during touch-mediated human social interactions allows for dynamic changes in interactants‚Äô behavior and physiological states. These emerging lines of evidence hint that the role of social touch unfurls over time, not just during a single social interaction but over the course of whole relationships."

Awe is often experienced through encounters with other people‚Äö√Ñ√¥s courage and kindness, nature, collective gatherings (dance, rituals, and ceremonies), music, visual art, religious and spiritual practice, epiphanies, and birth and death (Bai et al., 2017; Keltner, 2023). Within this broad landscape of awe, theoretical and empirical evidence suggest potential intra and interpersonal benefits (e.g., Monroy & Keltner, 2022). This symposium builds on the emergent science of awe and highlights recent research examining the relation between awe and cognitive and social outcomes: including (1) expanding the scope of attention toward the environment; (2) envisioning diverse perspectives and possibilities (e.g., temporal distancing); (3) fostering forgiveness of past transgressions; and (4) promoting integration into communities and/or social groups. This symposium offers diverse insights from a selection of nine studies, conducted in two countries, with diverse methodologies such as field studies, daily diary techniques, and in lab studies.\n\n\nTitle: The Effect of Positive-Awe and Threatening-Awe on Attentional Scope\nTime: 15:15-15:30\nAuthors: Chenxiao Zhao\nAbstract: Awe is an emotional response to perceptually vast stimuli that transcend one‚Äôs current frames of reference. Previous research found that awe could facilitate global and holistic processing and thus broadens our attentional scope. However, recent studies suggest that awe can be differentiated in terms of positive-awe and threatening-awe, each associated with distinct neural mechanisms. Also, considering that previous research has shown that positive vs.¬†negative emotions affect the attentional scope differently, in the current study, we aim to clarify whether positive-awe and threatening-awe exert different effects on the attentional scope. In Experiment 1, we independently evoked positive-awe and threatening-awe using videos and subsequently measured their effects on attentional scope with Navon task. Our results suggested positive-awe and threatening-awe affect attentional scope similarly. Experiment 2 replicated these effects after controlling for stimulus size. In Experiment 3 we aim to measure attentional scope in a more immersive way (during awe experiences instead of after the awe-induction), and eye movements are tracked to reveal the potential differences on attention-grabbing effect between different types of awe. Insights and recommendations to study how awe affects low-level attentional mechanisms will be discussed.\n¬†\nTitle: Many Paths to Presence: Mechanisms of the Relation Between Awe and Animism\nTime: 15:30-15:45\nAuthors: Ostafin, Brian\nAbstract: Spiritual experiences involving awe are often accompanied by a feeling of presence, as illustrated in the experience of animism. The current research examined the influence of awe on animism and whether this main effect can be explained in part by each of three potential mechanisms of uncertainty, trust in intuition, and ego dissolution. The study used a community sample (N=344) and assigned participants into one of three mood-induction conditions consisting of videos to elicit awe, humor, or relaxation. The results indicated that compared to humor and relaxation, the awe participants reported greater experience of animism and life meaning. The awe-meaning relation was mediated by animism. The awe-animism relation was mediated by uncertainty, trust in intuition, and ego dissolution when examined in separate regression analyses and by trust in intuition and ego dissolution when examined simultaneously in a multiple mediator analysis. The results suggest that awe may elicit the experience of a world that is meaningful because it is a world that is alive, and that the aliveness of the world during awe may be especially due to the loss of ego and greater weight given to intuitive experience.\n¬†\nTitle: Awe and Temporal Distancing\nTime: 15:45-16:00\nAuthors: √ñzge Ugurlu\nAbstract: Experiencing awe increases well-being and has been associated with improved stress-related symptoms, yielding resilience against stress. However, our understanding of the mechanism by which awe leads to adaptive well-being outcomes is still limited. Considering that awe might change one‚Äö√Ñ√¥s time perception, we further explored whether one pathway to wellbeing might be through temporal distancing, defined as viewing a negative experience as being in the future. To investigate this, we conducted a daily diary study during a global stressor, the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to previous research, our results indicate that daily experiences of awe predict greater resilience against the stressor, COVID-19 in this context. Moreover, our mediation analysis revealed that daily experiences of awe also predicts higher levels of temporal distancing which mediates the link between awe and resilience. In sum, in the event of a global pandemic, if people remind themselves that their feelings are temporary, they are more likely to cope with their stressors.\n¬†\nTitle: The Influence of Awe on Social Integration\nTime: 16:00-16:15\nAuthors: Maria Monroy\nAbstract: Theoretical and empirical evidence in the science of awe suggest that awe promotes social integration. In a series of methodologically diverse studies (N = 1,143), we tested this claim and found evidence that awe is associated with greater social integration‚Äîin terms of openness to others, collective orientation, connectedness to others, and perceptions and behavioral intentions of inclusion. We first tested this claim in trait-like tendencies and found that awe prone people tend to be more open-minded, more collective oriented, feel more connectedness to others, and are more inclusive of others (Studies 1 & 4). Second, in in-vivo studies in nature, self-reports of awe were related to greater connectedness to others (Studies 2a & 2b). Third, in day-to-day life, on days when people experienced more awe than typical, they also experienced greater connectedness and openness to different cultures (Study 3). Fourth and last, in an experimental study, people induced to experience awe were more inclusive of People of Color (Study 4). Across these studies, the effects of awe were unique and beyond the effects of other positive emotions. This work provides evidence suggesting that experiences of awe are associated with different aspects of social integration and provides promise for future interventions.\n¬†\nTitle: Discussion\nTime: 16:15-16:30\nAuthors: Keltner, Dacher"

Identifying emotions arising in VR intergroup interactions between historically rival groups is relevant for favouring positive interactions. This study analysed the emergence of emotions in a VR intergroup verbal exchange. Catholic and Protestant participants (N = 60) in Northern Ireland worked jointly in a VR activity under 3 group salience conditions (Common Ingroup Identity, Intergroup Identity, Control). One participant in each dyad was, in fact, a pre-trained confederate. Avatars wore Union Jack (Protestant) or Irish flag (Catholic) t-shirts denoting group membership. The Common Ingroup condition used ‚ÄúTeam Member‚Äù nameplates (i.e., team prime), whereas the Intergroup condition did not include this prime (e.g., ‚ÄúPlayer‚Äù); the Control used neutral outfits. In addition, confederates either helped participants with a difficult virtual task or not, testing the impact of prosocial behaviour. Results showed no effect of group identity salience on positive, negative, anxious or angry emotion word use. However, the confederate‚Äôs prosocial behaviour significantly predicted participant positive emotion word use (e.g.¬†good, love, happy) and verbal mimicry. Enacting solidarity through prosocial acts, not belonging to common ingroups, drove positive emotions in VR verbal interactions.\n¬†\nTitle: Avatar Emotions: Evaluation of Dynamic Facial Expressions Transferred from Human Actors to Embodied Agents\nTime: 15:30-15:45\nAuthors: Tornberg, Christina; Laukka, Petri\nAbstract: In the rapidly evolving field of social robotics, understanding the role of emotional expressions in embodied agents is pivotal. Emotional exchanges shape the tone of social interactions and play a crucial role in robot acceptance. Despite this significance, the lack of a methodologically robust pool of emotional stimuli for modeling expressions in embodied agents remains a challenge. In the current study, stimuli were selected from a newly developed database wherein actors conveyed a large number of emotions (N = 44) through facial, vocal and bodily expressions. In addition to video, the stimuli were also recorded using a custom iPhone app specifically designed to capture the facial motion of the actor and transfer that onto an embodied agent. In this evaluation study, we focus on facial expressions of boredom, concentration, confusion, determination, disappointment, doubt, gratitude, and interest ‚Äì which are all emotions relevant to social interactions. Participants were instructed to rate stimuli portraying the above emotions in a forced-choice experiment. In this experiment, the facial expressions were presented in three conditions: (1) the original actor portrayals, (2) MetaHuman avatars, and (3) the Furhat robot (all presented on a computer screen). Data collection is ongoing, but we will present recognition rates for all emotions across all presentation conditions together with confusion matrices that show which emotions were confused with each other. The comparison of recognition rates across presentation conditions will offer novel insights into the efficient transfer of emotional signals from humans to embodied agents.\n¬†\nTitle: Social Acceptability of Being Touched by a Virtual Agent\nTime: 15:45-16:00\nAuthors: Boucaud, Fabien; Pelachaud, Catherine; Richard, Gr√©goire; Thouvenin, Indira\nAbstract: Social touch, instances of interpersonal touch considered for their social meanings, has been shown by previous studies to facilitate emotional communication and regulation, provide physical well-being, and be heavily involved in relational bonding. In the field of affective computing, socially interactive agents (SIA, embodied artificial characters designed for social interactions with humans) are being endowed with more and more social abilities (understanding of natural language, emotion recognition, use of non-verbal behaviour) that allow them to communicate emotions, elicit feelings of empathy or to bond with human users. Endowing SIAs with the ability to touch could help them to better communicate emotions and empathy and to improve their relationship-building abilities towards human users, especially for those in situations of isolation. Touch is a very sensitive modality, however, and loses all its positive effects when used invasively. We present a study aimed at determining when touch from an agent encountered in virtual reality (VR) is both socially meaningful (conveys a clear emotion or social intention) and acceptable (not invasive nor unexpected). Users were embodied through a virtual avatar and played a game in VR while being encouraged by our agent, either only verbally or with an accompanying touch. Our results highlight that at the social interaction level, feelings of interactivity and familiarity are important for an acceptable and meaningful touch, while at the physical level, the level of embodiment felt by the users and how much they appreciate the touch sensation modulates how well they accept it.\n¬†\nTitle: From Virtual to Reality: Mapping Dynamic Emotions and Physiology in VR Environments\nTime: 16:00-16:15\nAuthors: D‚ÄôAmelio, Tom√°s Ariel; Tagliazucchi, Enzo\nAbstract: This study ventures into the emerging intersection of affective neuroscience and affective computing by creating the first public database documenting real-time self-reports of emotional experiences in immersive virtual reality (VR) environments, in conjunction with a range of physiological measures. In this way, we aim to deepen our understanding of the temporal dynamics of emotions by using VR to create highly immersive experiences that closely resemble real-world situations. By incorporating both central and peripheral measures, the study aims to capture the complex interplay between subjective emotional experiences and their physiological correlates. The focus is on the fluid nature of emotions, with an emphasis on continuous self-reporting to better understand their evolving nature. VR provides a unique and controlled environment for eliciting and studying emotional responses, thereby enhancing the reliability of the data. Key goals include characterizing the neural and physiological correlates of affective experiences in VR, analyzing their temporal dynamics, and investigating the relationship between subjective reports and physiological data. This comprehensive approach promises not only to enrich the scientific understanding of emotions, but also to improve the predictive capabilities of affective computational models. It represents a significant step forward in accurately capturing and interpreting the full range of human emotional experiences in dynamic, naturalistic settings."

For example, people can reduce this gap by elevating themselves to the envied‚Äôs superior level. We propose that the envious person‚Äôs self-efficacy can determine their reaction to envy. Specifically, envious individuals who believe in their ability to achieve goals (high self-efficacy) will strive to elevate themselves to the envied‚Äôs superior level. However, envious people experiencing low self-efficacy, will deal with envy differently (e.g., harming the envied, cognitive reappraisal). In two experiments, we found that boosting self-efficacy improved the envious person‚Äôs performance when the boost was in a different domain from envy, but not when the boost was in the same domain as envy. We suggest two possible explanations for the impact of domain (dis)similarity on self-efficacy effectiveness. First, affirming one‚Äôs value in a domain different from the envy domain can compensate for threats to self-worth in the envy domain (self-affirmation). Since envy is a reaction to a self-threat, self-affirming in a different domain might focus people on their abilities (vs.¬†their inferiorities), thus improving performance. Second, being inferior to another in the envy domain and then, through self-efficacy boosting, learning that one is highly qualified in the same domain may create cognitive dissonance. This cognitive dissonance can undermine the self-efficacy boost, hence inhibiting changes in performance. We will present the two studies and potentially a third study examining these two explanations.\n¬†\nTitle: Differences Between Happy-for and Schadenfreude: Insights from Structural Topic Modeling.\nTime: 15:30-15:45\nAuthors: Feng, Roujia; Qin, Kaiyang; Cao, Wenrui\nAbstract: This study investigated the nuanced positive emotions of happy-for-ness and schadenfreude. Analyzing 774 recall documents of 399 participants via structural topic modeling, we identified a total of 8 topics and observed significant differences in the topics related to the emotions of happy-for-ness and schadenfreude. The findings reveal that, compared to happy-for-ness, the experience of schadenfreude exhibits greater complexity in terms of topics. Firstly, schadenfreude covers a broader spectrum of content whereas happy-for-ness topics tend to be more focused. Specifically, there are 5 topics associated more with schadenfreude compared to 2 topics associated more with happy-for-ness. Besides, topics more prevalent in happy-for-ness experiences exhibit clear and positive connections with both relationship closeness and magnitude. Conversely, for topics more prevalent in schadenfreude documents, the relationships are more complex, with each topic displaying unique connections with relationship closeness and magnitude. The research offers valuable insights into the complexity of these emotions.\n¬†\nTitle: The Impact of Social Identity Threat on Loneliness among Unemployed People in Germany\nTime: 15:45-16:00\nAuthors: Loreth, Lukas; Simon, Bernd\nAbstract: Unemployed people experience stigmatization in daily life which can lead them to worry about not fitting in, of not belonging and to being excluded due to being a member of a stigmatized group ‚Äì dubbed social identity threat. Thus, experiences of social identity threat can frustrate one‚Äôs need for belonging. As prior research indicates, unmet belongingness needs can lead to loneliness. However, the impact of social identity threat on loneliness remains unclear. Thus, this research aimes to answer two questions: How does social identity threat frustrate one‚Äôs need for belonging, and does it induce feelings of loneliness? A possible mechanism is that social identity threat triggers negative emotions such as fear, shame, and anger that can proactively undermine one‚Äôs sense of social belonging and elicit loneliness. To answer these questions two studies were conducted with unemployed people living in Germany. In Study 1 (N = 445), a panel survey was employed and found that social identity threat positively predicted loneliness at a later point in time. Results also supported the robustness of relationship after controlling for sociodemographic and competing predictor variables. Study 2 (N = 329) provided experimental evidence of this link by manipulating exposure to social identity threat cues through mental imagery. Mediation analysis indicated that this is due to amplified emotions of anger and shame as well as a reduced sense of social belonging. However, fear did not mediate the link between social identity threat and loneliness. Both studies indicate that social identity threat is an antecedent of loneliness.\n¬†\nTitle: Socio-Communicative Interpretation of Facial Expressions Requires Social Context\nTime: 16:00-16:15\nAuthors: Allison, Bronagh M; McKeown, Gary\nAbstract: The debate over the function of facial expressions continues with the Behavioural Ecology View of facial displays (BECV), which argues for a more socio-communicative function for facial expression, compared with the Basic Emotions Theory (BET), which gives felt emotion as the prime causal basis for facial expressions. Gossip is a common form of human socio-communicative behaviour. Observations of gossip can be an opportunity to examine the social context-driven display of facial expressions. We predicted that facial expressions associated with the emotion term surprise‚Äîin the BET tradition‚Äîoccurring in response to social information will be interpreted differently when presented in the context of the social interaction in which it occurs. Moments of gossip from the dyadic conversational social interactions in the Belfast Storytelling Database were coded. Participants (N=273) were presented with video clips containing gossip or a control group with non-gossip (backchanneling). They were presented in two contexts: minimal and full. Minimal-context clips showed only the receiver‚Äôs facial expression and no audio, while full-context clips presented interlocutors and audio. We fitted linear mixed-effect models in a 2 (social signal: gossip or non-gossip) x 2 (context: full or minimal) factorial design to examine their relationship with perceived levels of gossip and surprise. Absolute levels of perception of gossip and surprise were similar. We found participants perceived significantly more gossip in the full context, while there were no significant differences in perception of surprise dependent on context. The facial expression of surprise may have a default interpretation of surprise but requires socio-communicative context to be perceived as gossip-related."

This study has two objectives: i) to analyze the impact of language on emotional regulation in children with and without developmental language disorder (DLD); ii) to evaluate the impact of emotional prosody on emotional identification in children with and without DLD. For the first objective, vocabulary was assessed in time 1 and emotional regulation in time 2 (four years later) in a sample of 43 school-age children with and without DLD. For the second, two experiments were run in 60 school-age children with and without DLD through the eye-tracking technique. Four emotional faces were presented at the same time as a sentence, explicit in Exp1 (e.g., ‚ÄúLaura is happy‚Äù) and implicit in Exp2 (e.g., ‚ÄúCristina escapes from the dog‚Äù), was heard. The results of the first objective showed that expressive language significantly predicted the emotional regulation assessed four years later in all children. On the other hand, the results of the eye-tracking showed in both experiments that typically developing (TD) children discarded prosodic cues to identify emotions and they preferred the face that is congruent with the semantic content of the phrase. In children with DLD, instead, prosodic cues interfere more with emotion identification. In conclusion, vocabulary richness significantly impacts emotional regulation, moreover, emotional prosody is a key dimension for emotional understanding, especially in population with DLD.\n¬†\nTitle: Putting Feelings into Words: Do Moroccan Learners of English Describe Others‚Äô Emotions as Native Speakers?\nTime: 15:30-15:45\nAuthors: El asri, Khalid\nAbstract: Emotions are expressed and conceptualized differently across cultures (Pavlenko, 2005). Considering the languages investigated in this study, differences in the conceptualization of emotions between English and Moroccan Arabic would likely be greater since both varieties belong to distinct cultural dimensions (individualism and collectivism). Differences in the way emotions are conceptualized in these varieties, therefore, would pose problems for Moroccan learners of English, because they are required to make finer-grained distinction in using L2 emotion terms that may not exist in their L1. Nevertheless, it is predicted that emotion description would not be as difficult for advanced learners as intermediate learners. Rather, advanced learners would approximate native speakers in describing emotions of others since the range of situations and contexts in which English emotions are used require a higher proficiency level of English. To verify this hypothesis, 60 native speakers of English, 60 advanced learners, and 60 intermediate learners were asked to watch a short film and describe how actors felt at some suggested scenes by using one emotion word. The results revealed that advanced learners of English had rich emotion vocabularies and many of their lexical choices approximated those of native speakers. They, however, did not manage to provide the same emotion terms for some scenes as native speakers. On the other hand, intermediate learners quite managed to provide emotion terms as native speakers, but they differed from native speakers in many of their lexical choices. Based on these findings, some pedagogical implications are suggested.\n¬†\nTitle: Detecting Emotions in the Speech of Patients with Acquired Brain Injury: a Feasibility Study\nTime: 15:45-16:00\nAuthors: Klein, Salom√©; Krasny-Pacini, Agata; Todirascu, Amalia; Vassiliadou, H√©l√®ne\nAbstract: Patients with an Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) suffer from emotional dysregulation for which treatments lack evidence. Patient‚Äôs lack of insight and alexithymia biases usual patient-reported outcome measures. The aim of the study is to explore a novel objective measure of emotional regulation through linguistic markers, that could serve to test the effectiveness of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), in ABI. Methods: Along with other usual outcome measures, 45 patients with chronic ABI were voice-recorded on 40-90 minutes semi-directive interview and picture description, in which they narrated emotionally-charged memories and explained their perception of free will according to their emotional dysregulation at the time points 5-month apart: 5 months baseline, and immediately before therapy (to explore retest effects and stability of response) and immediately after therapy (to explore for gains due to a 5-month intensive DBT). Outcome measures consisted of the typology of explicit/implicit emotional expressions, the annotation and the automatic detection of emotional scripts in patients‚Äô speech. Our protocol considers that emotional narration does not only involve prototypical expressions (e.g.¬†‚ÄòI am angry‚Äô), but a multitude of emotional means (designated, suggested and/or displayed emotions), allowing thus to measure differently the evolution of patients regarding naming and recognizing emotions. We present preliminary results about the feasibility of this measure and the performance of the annotation guide by comparing it to other projects (Emotex, Emolex). This exploratory measure considers both neuropsychological and linguistic literature and conceptualize ABI disorders as the result of emotions that are too strong and/or poorly managed by the patient.\n¬†\nTitle: Shared Narratives: A Corpus-Based Study of Gendered Language in Depression Podcasts\nTime: 16:00-16:15\nAuthors: Tomas, Fr√©d√©ric; Braun, Nadine; Goudbeek, Martijn\nAbstract: Women are generally believed to be more emotionally expressive and perceptive than men, an idea which is at least partially supported by scientific studies. However, results are inconsistent. This can be potentially problematic since such believes nurture existing gender stereotypes. Specifically in clinical settings, this may lead to a myriad of issues. This study therefore tested the hypothesis that men and women exhibit distinct linguistic patterns in oral conversations about their own depression in a podcast setting as a part of our Affective Language in Social mediA (ALISA) corpus. We compiled 13 transcripts (Nwords = 21,423) from a public depression podcast. In each episode, the host posed an open-ended question to prompt guests to share their depression experiences. Uninterrupted responses were transcribed and cleaned for analysis. The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) was used to extract common gender-specific language. Based on inferential and Bayesian approaches and considering the number of words in each transcript, ANCOVAs were run to test the hypothesis. Results reveal a consistent absence of significant gender-based differences in linguistic behavior. Bayesian Factor values consistently favored null models, contradicting the prediction that men and women speak differently when discussing depression. Discussion points include challenging traditional assumptions and stereotypes about gender-specific communication in mental health contexts, emphasizing the apparent universality of verbal expression surrounding depression, and considering implications for mental-health support strategies that transcend traditional gender norms. Our future research will focus on expanding the ALISA corpus to better understand individuals‚Äô naturalistic linguistic behavior in mental-health contexts."

In a first large-scale study, we measured variation in dynamic facial behaviour during social interaction and examined dyadic outcomes and impression formation. In Study 1, we recorded semi-structured video calls with 52 participants interacting with a confederate across various everyday contexts. Video clips were rated by 176 independent participants. In Study 2, we examined video calls of 1315 participants engaging in unstructured video-call interactions. Facial expressivity indices were extracted using automated Facial Action Coding System analysis and measures of personality and partner impressions were obtained by self-report. Facial expressivity varied considerably across participants, but little across contexts, social partners or time. Prototypical expressions of emotion also did not vary according to behavioural context as might be expected. In Study 1, more facially expressive participants were more well-liked, agreeable, and successful at negotiating (if also more agreeable). Participants who were more facially competent, readable, and perceived as readable were also more well-liked. In Study 2, we replicated the findings that facial expressivity was associated with agreeableness and liking by their social partner, and additionally found it to be associated with extraversion and neuroticism. Across both studies, prototypical expressions of emotion were produced at a low rate. Findings suggest that facial behaviour is a stable individual difference that proffers social advantages, pointing towards an affiliative, adaptive function.\n¬†\nTitle: A Systematic Examination of the Causal Determinants of Affect\nTime: 15:30-15:45\nAuthors: Sz≈±cs, Tam√°s; Wu, Yufei; Tuerlinckx, Francis; Moors, Agnes\nAbstract: A large amount of research effort goes into studying affect, its constituent elements, its dynamics, and its role in mental disorders, mental health, resilience, and decision making. However, surprisingly little is known about the causal determinants of affect. Although several determinants have been proposed by different theories, systematic research comparing the impact of the various determinants is scarce. Previous research from disparate areas, such as consumer research, experimental aesthetics, and affective science, often only incidentally reported on the effects and interactions of affect determinants using various operationalizations, making the scarce findings difficult to compare and synthesize. Here, we examine the effects of goal congruence, goal relevance, unexpectedness, and reward prediction errors on self-reported affect in a simple probabilistic choice task. Participants are presented with a number of doors, each hiding a monetary reward or loss. They are informed about the probabilities of the possible outcomes (e.g., 3 doors hide +2‚Ç¨, 2 doors hide -1‚Ç¨). After a participant has chosen a door, and the outcome is revealed, they are asked to report on their subjective affect using a single-item measure. We report the effects and interactions of the selected causal determinants of affect, and compare the different operationalizations of these determinants found in the literature. We hope that this systematic study can help map out the complexity involved in the antecedents of affect and contribute to providing a stable foundation for affective science.\n¬†\nTitle: Affective and Computational Mechanisms Underlying Pavlovian Learning Biases\nTime: 15:45-16:00\nAuthors: Stussi, Yoann; Sander, David\nAbstract: Pavlovian threat conditioning is a fundamental process by which individuals learn to anticipate threats in the environment. While research has shown that humans learn more rapidly and more persistently to associate negative and positive emotional stimuli with aversive events beyond their inherent threat value, the computations underlying these Pavlovian learning biases remain unclear. Building on work testing the predictions of different emotion theories, we here examine the computational underpinnings of Pavlovian learning biases for negative and positive emotional stimuli. We applied computational-modeling techniques to data from four experiments (N = 247) using a differential Pavlovian threat conditioning paradigm. Threat-relevant (angry faces or snakes), positive-relevant (baby faces, happy faces, or erotic stimuli), and neutral (neutral faces or colored squares) stimuli were used as conditioned stimuli, with skin conductance response serving as an index of learning. Results indicate that a reinforcement-learning model distinguishing between excitatory (e.g., learning from reinforcement during acquisition) and inhibitory (e.g., learning from the absence of reinforcement during extinction) learning best explained the observed data. Whereas no evidence for faster Pavlovian conditioning was found at the computational level, both threat- and positive-relevant stimuli were associated with a lower inhibitory learning rate compared to neutral stimuli, contributing to weakening extinction learning to affectively relevant stimuli. These findings offer new insights into the affective and computational mechanisms underlying Pavlovian learning biases and advance our understanding of how humans learn to attribute and update affective value to their environment.\n¬†\nTitle: A Heuristic Approach to Categorize Emotion Theories in Psychology\nTime: 16:00-16:15\nAuthors: Muto, Sera\nAbstract: This theoretical study presents a heuristic approach to categorize emotion theories in psychology. There are numerous emotion theories that researchers, especially early career researchers, including graduate and undergraduate students, may consider to believe and adapt for their research. It is important to categorize emotion theories appropriately and know their similarities and differences to study emotions. Thus, this study examines a heuristic approach to determine critical similarities and differences in categorizing emotion theories and creates a simplified chart to select an appropriate theory based on the researcher‚Äôs belief about emotions. Based on Moors‚Äô (2022) typology of emotion theories in psychology, this study focuses on six emotion theories: (a) evolutionary theories or basic emotion theories, (b) network theories, (c) appraisal theories, (d) Moors‚Äô goal-directed theory, (e) Barrett‚Äôs psychological constructionist theory, and (g) Russell‚Äôs psychological constructionist theory. A theoretical review found that there are five fundamental questions to differentiate these emotion theories: (1) scientific status (whether the folk set of emotion can be a scientific set), (2) componential causal mechanism (whether there are causal relationships in components of emotion), (3) emotion-specific mechanism (whether special-purpose mechanism is involved in the emotion process), (4) innate or learning (whether emotion process is innate rather than learned), and (5) categorization (whether categorization is necessary to experience emotions). This argument leads to the fundamental question of what emotions are; however, the results suggest that these five questions may be enough to categorize influential emotion theories in psychology, and will help to decide which theory to believe.\n¬†\nTitle: No Laughing Matter: Creating and Interpreting Emotions Through Interaction\nTime: 16:15-16:30\nAuthors: Howes, Christine; Maraev, Vladislav; Breitholtz, Ellen\nAbstract: The theory of constructed emotion (Barrett, 2017) posits that emotions are not present in the brain a priori, but rely on our interpretation of affective states. This interpretation is driven by shared cultural emotion concepts which we use to categorise our feelings. However, this view places too much emphasis on internal cognition. In our view, the driving force for creating and interpreting emotion is interaction, and ‚Äòemotions‚Äô are constructed through discourse. One advantage of this approach is that emotions are not taken to be different in this regard from other types of concepts. Underpinning this is an action-based account of meaning (Eshghi et al., 2022). Any given action (including linguistic actions) provides constraints on potential follow-up actions, but does not determine them. Agents opportunistically pursue affordances relevant to their current goals by engaging directly with the environment, including their interlocutors. This serves to confirm or disconfirm their expectations rather than enriching intermediate brain-internal representations. Following Breitholtz (2020), we model affordances in the form of topoi ‚Äì non-monotonic and defeasible principles of reasoning recognised within a socio-cultural community. For example, in the case of emotion the associated topoi for some collection of actions may suggest an interpretation of one‚Äôs own or another‚Äôs behaviours as due to nervousness or, conversely, excitement, depending on the interactional context (see also Frijda et al., 2014). We provide examples of laughter in dialogue, where, for example, laughter may be interpreted as signalling nervousness in a job interview, or mis-interpreted as displaying a non-serious stance towards the situation.

Although the importance of interpersonal processes is widely acknowledged, much research treats social emotions as intrapsychic phenomena, overlooking the interplay between intra- and interpersonal aspects. Across disciplines and methodological approaches, this symposium unites research providing new insights into how intra- and interpersonal processes interact in shaping emotional outcomes. Talk 1 highlights this interplay showing that the effectiveness of music teachers' evaluative emotional expressions in influencing students' performance varies depending on personality. Talk 2 dissociates internal and external self-relevance in envy, showing that being outperformed in internally self-relevant domains fosters benign envy, while being outperformed in domains valued by others fosters malicious envy. Talk 3 elucidates the emergence of embarrassment in infants and young children, exploring the influence of contextual factors that question traditional perspectives on embarrassment's onset and prerequisites. Talk 4 examines economic behavior during negotiations, revealing that individuals strategically exaggerate expressions of supplication emotions like sadness, but not appeasement emotions like shame. Talk 5 demonstrates that shame and pride and their action tendencies of concealment and exposure are elicited even by events occurring in private and that their intensity hinges also on the relevance of observers to individuals' status showing that intrapersonal and interpersonal theories of pride and shame need to be integrated. Taken together, these studies provide new insights into intra- and inter-personal processes of emotions and highlight why it is important to take their interactions into account.\n\n\nTitle: How Music Teachers‚Äô Emotional Expressions Shape Students‚Äô Performance: ‚Äúc‚Äôest Le Ton Qui Fait La Musique‚Äù\nTime: 9:15-9:30\nAuthors: Gerben van Kleef, Eftychia Stamkou\nAbstract: Teachers, parents, and other feedback providers commonly express positive emotions to stimulate learning. When students‚Äô performance is below expectations, however, feedback providers may be inclined to express negative emotions. How these different emotional styles shape students‚Äô development remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the effects of music teachers‚Äô positive versus negative emotional expressions on their students‚Äô musical performance. We draw on Emotions as Social Information (EASI) theory, which postulates that the effects of emotional expressions depend on targets‚Äô dispositional information-processing motivation (which determines whether feedback is extracted from emotional expressions) and agreeableness (which determines the perceived appropriateness of positive vs.¬†negative expressions). We followed music teachers and students during regular learning sessions. One week before the sessions, we assessed students‚Äô information-processing motivation and agreeableness. Immediately after the sessions, students reported on their teachers‚Äô emotional expressions during the session, and teachers rated the performance of students on two musical tasks. An outside expert evaluated recordings of a subset of these performances. Consistent with the EASI framework, students who were confronted with stronger positive emotional expressions of their teachers performed better to the extent that they were lower on information-processing motivation and higher on agreeableness. Conversely, students who were confronted with stronger negative emotional expressions performed better to the degree that they were higher on information- processing motivation and lower on agreeableness. These findings indicate that both positive and negative emotional expressions of teachers can benefit students‚Äô performance, depending on the student‚Äôs personality. We discuss implications for feedback, emotions, and education.\n¬†\nTitle: Chasing Dreams or Social Standards? How Internal and External Self-Relevance Shape Envy.\nTime: 9:30-9:45\nAuthors: Jan Crusius\nAbstract: What do people envy? People envy others for subjectively important characteristics, achievements, and possessions‚Äîself-relevance is a necessary precondition for envy. However, self- relevance can have different sources. It can be defined by what people truly value themselves, i.e., what is internally self-relevant. It can also be defined by what is valued by their social context, i.e., what is externally self-relevant. This distinction could matter for how envy evolves. Based on their appraisal patterns, we predicted that internal and external self-relevance differentially shape the distinct forms of envy: Internal self-relevance should promote benign envy (entailing upward motivation) and decrease malicious envy (entailing hostility). External self-relevance should decrease benign envy and increase malicious envy. We conducted 7 preregistered studies (total N = 2.050). In the first set, we measured internal and external self-relevance of certain values within subjects. In the second set, we manipulated internal and external self-relevance between subjects. We measured participants‚Äô envious reactions towards an ideal person embodying these values. Meta-analyses support that high internal self-relevance predicted and lead to more benign envy and to less malicious envy. External self-relevance was associated with less benign and more malicious envy, although this effect was less consistent. Thus, being outperformed in a domain that people value for its own sake fosters benign envy. In contrast, chasing success in a domain that is prescribed by their social group may set people up to experience malicious envy.\n¬†\nTitle: Self-Conscious Emotional Arousal in Infancy and Early Childhood\nTime: 9:45-10:00\nAuthors: Milica Nikolic, Cristina Colonnesi, Disa Sauter\nAbstract: The study of self-conscious emotional arousal in young children has been limited, possibly due to the assumption that complex socio-cognitive skills, such as self- awareness and mentalizing, are prerequisites for the emergence of self-conscious emotions. However, recent theoretical and empirical developments in developmental and cognitive sciences suggest that children may, in fact, experience and express self-conscious emotional arousal during social interactions from an early age. Here, we present findings from a proof-of-concept study where we induced and measured self-conscious emotional arousal, observed through facial expressions and physiological blushing, in children aged 3-5 years. During a photoshoot, children received compliments from the experimenter, and in the control condition, another person underwent the same procedure. Results indicated that children exhibited significantly more self-conscious emotional arousal, as indicated by more coy-smiles, when receiving compliments compared to when another person receives compliments. Building on this, we are currently setting up a study involving infants aged 6-36 months to investigate whether they, like older children, might experience and express self-conscious emotional arousal during social interactions. In this study, we also measure infants‚Äô self-awareness using the mirror self-recognition task, aiming to determine whether self-conscious emotional arousal depends on the ability to recognize oneself. Preliminary results from this study, along with those from the proof-of-concept study, will be presented at the conference. These findings will answer whether and when infants demonstrate self-conscious emotional arousal in social interactions, thereby shedding light on the prerequisites of self-conscious emotional arousal.\n¬†\nTitle: The Strategic Display of Supplication Versus Appeasement Emotions in Negotiations\nTime: 10:00-10:15\nAuthors: Zi Ye, Eric van Dijk, Gert-Jan Lelieveld\nAbstract: The current research focuses on the strategic use of supplication emotion (i.e., emotions like disappointment and sadness, which serve as a call for help) and appeasement emotions (i.e., emotions like guilt and shame, which communicate that one has done something wrong). Given that negotiators realize that their emotions can influence their opponents‚Äô behaviors, negotiators may strategically communicate their emotions to obtain higher outcomes by adjusting the intensity of their emotions. The current research aims to investigate whether negotiators choose to exaggerate or downplay their disappointment or guilt (Study 1) and their sadness or shame (Study 2). To study this, we designed a two-person Ultimatum Bargaining setting in which participants indicated their truly experienced emotions (how much disappointment/sadness and guilt/shame they experienced) and what they wanted to communicate to their opponent (how much disappointment/sadness and guilt/shame they wanted to communicate) on a scale from 1-100. Participants indicated their experienced and communicated emotions either before or after opponents made their offer. Results showed that participants exaggerated the intensity of their disappointment (Study 1) and sadness (Study 2) before, but not after, opponents made their offer. Participants neither downplayed nor exaggerated their guilt (Study 1) and their shame (Study 2) both before and after opponents made their offer. Moreover, exaggerating disappointment was positively related to the motivation to earn as much as possible and negatively related to prosocial motivations. The current findings add to the literature on emotion deception and on the interpersonal effects of emotion in general.\n¬†\nTitle: A Systematic Examination of Shame and Pride‚Äôs Functions and Mechanisms Through Concealment and Exposure Behaviors\nTime: 10:15-10:30\nAuthors: Yiftach Argaman\nAbstract: Shame and pride are traditionally explained through two models. The Information Threat Model (Sznycer, 2010) focuses on interpersonal processes, positing that shame and pride arise when an event potentially impacts one‚Äôs social status. Conversely, the Process Model of Self-Conscious Emotions (Tracy & Robins, 2004) focuses on intrapersonal processes, positing that individuals feel shame or pride when events are incongruent or congruent with their identity goals. While both models assume link between shame-concealment and pride-exposure behaviors (the S/P-C/E association), they have different predictions regarding the conditions that elicit shame and pride and the content of concealment/exposure behaviors. In four experimental studies (Total N=1,000), we systematically examined the S/P-C/E association while juxtaposing the models‚Äô predictions. Experiment 1 developed an experimental procedure aimed at assessing the S/P-C/E relationship. Shame and pride were evoked by randomly assigning participants to either low or high fictitious IQ score conditions. Concealment/exposure behaviors were then assessed. Results provide strong evidence for the S/P-C/E association. Supporting the effect of interpersonal processes, Experiment 2 found that the S/P-C/E association is proportional to the potential impact of exposure on individuals‚Äô status. Supporting the effect of intrapersonal processes, we found that shame and pride drive individuals to conceal and expose themselves rather than only information about the event that triggered the emotion (Experiments 3-4), and that the S/P-C/E association occurs even when shame/pride is elicited in private events that remain undisclosed to others (Experiment 4). The (in)congruency of the results with existing models and the need for an integrative model are discussed."

In this symposium, we leverage theory-based approaches and cutting-edge statistical tools to describe the patterns of these age-related differences, to advance understanding of their underlying mechanisms, and to trace implications for well-being and health across the adult lifespan. The first presentation investigates age differences in emotional responding to controlled emotional film clips in a lifespan sample. Cross-random-effects models showed more intense and more complex responses in older than younger participants, with pronounced differences across emotions. The second presentation introduces a formalized theoretical approach to affect dynamics and employs this to everyday affective experience in an age-diverse sample. Results indicate complex, multi-directional age differences in affective processes. The third presentation investigates how people‚Äö√Ñ√¥s perception of time left to live is linked to age differences in everyday affective experience. Multilevel models showed that feeling closer to death was related to more negative affect, with strongest associations in middle-aged adults. Using data from longitudinal experience-sampling and dynamical structural equation modeling, the fourth presentation demonstrates age-related increases in prospective affect-health links throughout adulthood. These results suggest that health affects emotional experiences, and that emotional experiences affect health more strongly as people age. The fifth presentation uses parallel growth mixture modeling to investigate links between affective wellbeing and survival. This approach demonstrates the value of modeling multidimensional trajectories of affective well-being and their heterogeneous links to survival. Together, the symposium will showcase recent important advances in research on emotional aging.\n\n\nTitle: Emotional Reactivity to 66 Film Clips from Adolescence to Old Age\nTime: 9:15-9:30\nAuthors: Antje Rauers, Lukas Aaron Knitter, Markus Studtmann, Michaela Riediger\nAbstract: Film clips are frequently used to induce emotions in people from different age groups, often proceeding from the implicit assumption that such stimuli have comparable effects across age groups. However, conceptual reasons and empirical findings warrant doubts in this regard. Past evidence on age differences in subjective reactivity to emotional films is inconclusive, which may be due to the limited ‚Äì and heterogeneous ‚Äì age range, number of target emotions, and number of individual film stimuli included in past studies. The present study seeks to bridge these inconclusive results. We obtained N = 5843 individual ratings from N=99 persons (adolescents, younger adults, middle-aged adults, and older adults) who rated their subjective experience to N=66 film clips. These were selected based on appraisal theory to induce happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, or no emotion (neutral stimuli). We used crossed- random effects models to test for age differences in target-emotion intensity and emotion specificity (the tendency to primarily respond with the target emotion over other emotions). Age effects varied across target emotions and film clips. For most emotions, older adults and adolescents responded more strongly than younger and middle-aged adults, while no age differences were found for disgusting and neutral films. Emotional specificity was comparatively lower in older adults versus younger age groups for disgusting and neutral films, but higher, for happy films. Together, these results suggest that in studies using film clips as emotion-induction stimuli, age-fairness should not be taken for granted: It may be rather the exception than the rule.\n¬†\nTitle: Age Differences in Affect Dynamics: Testing Predictions of Socioemotional Selectivity Theory with the MIVA Model\nTime: 9:30-9:45\nAuthors: Maria Wirth, Andreas Voss, Klaus Rothermund\nAbstract: Emotional aging research is dominated by the idea of age-related improvements that result from shifts in motivation. Socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) proposes that as individuals age, they increasingly favor emotion-related goals and savor positive but avoid negative emotions. Previous age-comparative studies on everyday emotional experience typically were descriptive or studied the processes underlying emotional experience in isolation. We aimed at a more holistic approach to test hypotheses derived from SST regarding age-related differences in general emotional dispositions (i.e., anchoring), emotional reactivity, and emotion regulation by using a comprehensive computational approach. We applied our Model of Intraindividual Variability in Affect (MIVA) to data on everyday emotional experiences in an age-diverse sample (N = 378, age range 14 ‚Äì 86 years). Parameter estimations were carried out within a Bayesian framework. Our results provide partial support for predictions derived from SST. Consistent with SST, affect elicited by pleasant events was down-regulated less by older adults and affect elicited by unpleasant events was down-regulated more by older compared to younger adults. Inconsistent with SST, anchoring showed a negative age-related trend, indicating a more positive general affect disposition in younger, not older adults. Reactions to pleasant events showed no age-related differences. Reactivity to unpleasant events was highest in midlife and lower for younger and older adults. We discuss the broader implications of our approach for understanding emotional development across the lifespan.\n¬†\nTitle: Daily Subjective Aging and Affective Dynamics\nTime: 9:45-10:00\nAuthors: Shevaun D. Neupert, Lyndsey N. Graham\nAbstract: A core tenet of Socioemotional Selectivity Theory is that perception of time remaining in life plays a key role in the selection and pursuit of emotion regulation goals. The current study examined this idea within a daily diary framework, where subjective aging was captured by perceptions of nearness to death and perceptions of accelerated aging on consecutive days. Age differences in the within-person coupling between daily subjective aging reports and daily affective dynamics were tested. A 14-day daily diary study of 440 adults (M age = 65, range 50- 85) in the U.S. was conducted where participants reported on their subjective nearness to death, accelerated aging, physical health, positive affect, and negative affect each day. Multilevel models were conducted separately for positive and negative affect, adjusting for daily physical health. Individual differences in feeling farther away from death and a slower rate of aging were each associated with higher levels of positive affect. Daily negative affect was predicted by both within-person and between-person constructs. People who reported feeling subjective closer to death reported higher levels of negative affect. At the within-person level, on days when people reported feeling subjectively closer to death than their own average, they experienced an increase in negative affect. A significant interaction revealed that this effect was particularly strong among adults in midlife. These results suggest that daily manifestations of perceptions of limited time remaining in life are salient for daily affective dynamics, and that this salience is particularly pronounced among middle-aged adults relative to older adults.\n¬†\nTitle: Affect-Health Coupling from Adolescence to Old Age: Evidence from a Longitudinal Experience- Sampling Study\nTime: 10:00-10:15\nAuthors: Michaela Riediger, Fabian M√ºnch, Jennifer Bellingtier, Elisabeth S. Blanke, Cornelia Wrzus, Gloria Luong\nAbstract: While there is consensus that physical and emotional well-being are related, divergent claims have been made about possible age-related differences. This study aimed to investigate potential age-related differences in concurrent and prospective associations between everyday affective experiences and individuals‚Äô health and physical well-being. We used two waves of measurement burst data (wave 1: N = 398, 12 ‚Äì 90 years; wave 2: N = 365, 14 ‚Äì 88 years; inter- wave interval: M = 2.53 years). Per wave, participants provided 54 experience samples of their momentary affective and physical well-being. In addition, several person-level health indicators were assessed, including subjective health as well as number and severity of health conditions and complaints. Overall, results point to an age-related increase in affect-health coupling: The older participants were, the more strongly were health problems associated with lower concurrent affective well-being. Age moderations also emerged for prospective affect-health links, both across shorter (hours) and longer time intervals (years). Dynamical structural equation modeling showed an age-related increase in cross-lagged associations between individuals‚Äô time series of momentary emotional and physical well-being, assessed while participants pursued their normal daily routines. Similarly, moderated cross-lagged panel models yielded age-related increases in cross-lagged associations between everyday emotional well-being and indicators of physical health, assessed 2.5 years apart. Such age moderations emerged in both directions of cross-lagged associations (i.e., affect predicting later health, and health predicting later affect). This suggests that both the affective relevance of health impairments and the health-protective role of daily affective experiences may become more pronounced with advancing age.\n¬†\nTitle: Trajectories of Affective Well-Being and Survival in Middle-Aged and Older Adults\nTime: 10:15-10:30\nAuthors: Anthony D. Ong, Dakota W. Cintron\nAbstract: Affective experiences are key components of subjective well-being with important implications for health. However, little is known about heterogeneous longitudinal affect trajectories and their links to survival. This study identified joint trajectory subgroups based on 18-year changes in positive and negative affect and examined their differential associations with mortality risk. Participants were 3,250 adults (aged 39-93 years) from the Midlife in the U.S. study assessed over three waves (1995-2013). Parallel growth mixture modeling revealed three subgroups: (1) improving (increasing positive affect, decreasing negative affect), (2) deteriorating (decreasing positive affect, increasing negative affect), and (3) flourishing (high, stable positive affect, low, stable negative affect). Adjusting for baseline demographic and health covariates, Cox proportional-hazard results showed the improving group had the lowest mortality risk (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.35,1.32) and the deteriorating group had the highest mortality risk (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.34,3.55), relative to flourishing. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multidimensional trajectories of affective well-being and their heterogeneous links to survival."

Political psychologists have pointed to a role for emotions in explaining such behaviors. We examined the extent to which particular emotions predicted support for anti-democratic actions in the U.S. We conducted two survey studies measuring support for extreme behaviors, along with emotions and other predictors: one in the weeks before the 2020 election; the other starting on the evening of the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. We asked respondents to rate how often they felt various emotions toward Republican President Donald Trump and his Democratic Party opponent, Joe Biden, and the extent to which respondents would support Trump refusing to leave office if he lost the election. Study 1, fielded in a nationally representative sample of U.S. voters (n=1200) found that pride and enthusiasm toward Trump and contempt toward Biden emerged as the positive and negative emotions that most strongly predicted support for Trump refusing to leave office. Study 2 closely replicated these results in another sample of registered voters (n=287) immediately after Trump supporters attempted to stop Congress from certifying Biden‚Äôs election. Again, enthusiasm and pride toward Trump and contempt toward Biden were the most powerful predictors of support for Trump refusing to leave. These patterns of emotions align with findings from Tausch et al.¬†(2011) about contempt, as well as theories of intergroup conflict (e.g., Tajfel & Turner, 1979), and highlight specific emotions that may be involved in anti-democratic behavior.\n¬†\nTitle: Of Looming Threats: Affective and Behavioural Responses to Making Crises‚Äô Consequences Salient\nTime: 9:30-9:45\nAuthors: Ditrich, Lara; Febriana, S. Gina\nAbstract: Dire predictions about our planet‚Äôs future fill the news almost every day. These include reports on the effects of climate change and geopolitical crises alike. Viewing such reports can profoundly impact recipients‚Äô emotions and behaviour, even driving some to engage in collective action. Current models of collective action assign a central role to emotions when explaining individuals‚Äô engagement. In doing so, they primarily focus on anger about present injustices. We propose that a second emotional pathway plays an equally important role: fear of things taking a turn for the worse in the future. We shed light on this pathway in seven studies (total N=2149). Two studies in the context of climate change and the war in Ukraine suggest that making a crisis‚Äôs consequences salient indeed fosters fear ‚Äì if the consequences are described in a concrete fashion. The remaining studies focused on the climate crisis. They revealed larger increases in fear when consequences (vs.¬†causes) were highlighted, even controlling for anger. Fear, in turn, consistently correlated with higher collective action intentions. A final study showed that highlighting consequences also affected behaviour: Participants for whom consequences (vs.¬†causes) of climate change had been made salient invested more effort into collecting donations for a pro-environmental organization. In sum, our work implies that fear of a crisis‚Äôs consequences might be an important yet understudied emotional pathway shaping individuals‚Äô collective responses to contemporary crises. We will discuss the implications of our findings for the nature of the ‚Äúemotional pathway‚Äù in current models of collective action.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotions at War: What can Emotion Science Offer?\nTime: 9:45-10:00\nAuthors: Fischer, Agneta; Noor, Masi; Cheshin, Arik\nAbstract: The period leading up to World War II and the war itself has profoundly influenced the questions that were posed in (social) psychological research. How was it possible that the masses in Germany, but also in other parts of Europe were brainwashed with antisemitism; what does it tell us about mass behavior, about stereotypes; under which circumstances does prejudice develop, and so on. In the meantime, we have gained insight into group identities, group behavior, and group polarization, such that we can unmistakably observe the laws of group emotions in the current wars in Ukraine or Israel and Gaza. However, the political international world-wide crises require us to rethink the questions that we should pose for the answers that we seek. What can emotion science offer? We have knowledge about how negative emotions are strengthened, especially between groups, but we have much less systematic knowledge about the emotions and emotion strategies that are needed among such extreme circumstances: what emotions can help make life bearable, how can we support a road to peace, how can hate and revenge be replaced by understanding, trust, empathy and forgiveness? What drives these emotions, and under what circumstances can they blossom? In this talk, we will give some answers to these questions on the basis of previous research, but we will also ask new questions, and plea for new research lines to gain more insight into emotions during extreme conflicts.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotions in Political Rituals and in Inner Asian Tributary Relations\nTime: 10:00-10:15\nAuthors: Schwarz, Michal\nAbstract: Enthronization or political recognition in tributary relations was always extraordinary event in traditional international or interethnic relations in Inner Asia. These political rituals were usually celebrated on the occasion of creating a new alliance, in connection of establishing new dynasty or with succession of new hereditary or selected ruler. Because of interconnected religious and political institutions, the event had always many symbolic features connected to religious justification of power. These features were connected to A) understanding of sacred statecraft, B) ritual communication with spiritual world and C) emotions of ritual participants. After the comments to the spirits and sacred state, this paper will mainly focus on participant emotions. The analyzed data are based on 1) classical books with citations about the power of rituals, 2) cases of religious justification of power in royal edicts and on stele inscriptions, 3) historical events, 4) emotional value ascribed to particular symbols, 5) emotional expressions in ritual manuscripts. All mentioned sources provide comprehensive picture about involvement of emotions including established believes about ontological status of emotions like various states of happiness, eternal bliss etc. Note: As an important part of political and public life, the use of symbols and changing political rituals continue even during the colonial period and by contemporary Inner Asian neighbors including Vietnam and Korea."

However, reminiscent of past debates on emotions, many diverse and sometimes conflicting definitions of hate speech persist. Most notably, few studies have investigated hate speech as a multimodal phenomenon that is capable of eliciting complex subjective, physiological, and behavioural responses. We argue that this may be partially due to a predominant focus on ‚Äòhate text‚Äô in existing research. The current work capitalizes on recent advancements in automatic transcription and large language models (LLMs) to annotate a large new multimodal hate speech database, the WMHS. Based on a review of hate speech definitions, we provide a preview of the features of the WMHS, which currently consists of more than 8 hours of manually annotated multimodal hate speech episodes in Polish. By providing an open access mechanism to other researchers, we aim to facilitate new interdisciplinary approaches leveraging psychological research as well as machine- and deep-learning approaches to classify textual, auditory, and multimodal hate speech. Towards this aim, the final database will include comprehensive descriptive statistics, Polish transcriptions, translations, and expert-annotated ground truth data distinguishing between target groups, categories, and protected characteristics of auditory hate speech. We will discuss potential use cases, e.g., improved content moderation, as well as new perspectives for basic research into the socio-emotional underpinnings of hate speech and the differences between merely reading (about) hate speech and having to confront this phenomenon in the real world.\n¬†\nTitle: Using Artificial Intelligence to Understand People‚Äôs Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Strategies\nTime: 9:30-9:45\nAuthors: Li, Xiuhui; Chen, Yuhui; Lopez-Perez, Belen\nAbstract: Interpersonal emotion regulation, as defined by Niven et al.¬†(2009), employs various strategies like affective and cognitive engagement, attention, and humour to influence others‚Äô emotions. Traditional research in this area (Little et al.¬†2012; Lopez-Perez et al.¬†2017), often relies on questionnaires, which may not be effective for those with limited literacy or introspection skills. To address this, recent studies (Kwon & Lopez-Perez, 2021; Lopez-Perez et al., 2016) have adopted narrative-based methods, particularly for children, although these require time-intensive and potentially subjective qualitative analysis. Our research aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of open AI, specifically text-based models like ChatGPT and CLAUDE, in categorizing emotional content in narratives. We conducted two studies to compare AI performance against human coding in identifying regulation strategies from qualitative data. In Study 1, with 2824 responses, ChatGPT initially achieved Kappa values over .61. Refinements in coding instructions led to improved reliability (Ks &gt; .80) between ChatGPT and human coders. Study 2, with 2304 responses, demonstrated comparable accuracy using these refined instructions, achieving Ks &gt; .81. Additionally, testing CLAUDE with 1,152 narratives showed similar reliability (Ks &gt; .74). These results indicate that AI can effectively understand and categorize regulation strategies, although significant training is needed.\n¬†\nTitle: Textual Emotion and the Veracity of News Headlines: The Roles of Valence, Arousal, and Words Position\nTime: 9:45-10:00\nAuthors: Zhou, Xiaoyu\nAbstract: Research Background and Aim: Fake news tends to have different language patterns from real news. Language patterns have become a popular focus in deception research, whereas the role of emotional patterns is relatively overlooked.To offer a nuanced understanding of emotional cues in distinguishing fake news from real news, this study investigates how the interplay between textual emotion and words position relates to the veracity of health and gossip news headlines. Method: Drawing on datasets comprising 6,644 headlines with confirmed veracity, this research employs a lexicon of emotion norms and machine learning techniques to quantify emotional valence and arousal scores at the word level. To have a uniform understanding of the position, we normalize each headline‚Äôs length to the average length in their datasets. This algorithm adjusts a sentence‚Äôs raw emotion scores to fit this grid, maintaining a proportional representation of each word‚Äôs score. The algorithm operates in two ways, depending on the sentence length. For sentences shorter than or equal to the grid size, it directly maps each word‚Äôs score to the grid, using a rounding method based on the word‚Äôs position. For longer sentences, it first averages adjacent word scores, compressing the sentence to the grid size less or equal than the average size. Then these averaged scores are mapped to the grid following the first way. Results: Logistic regression was conducted to assess emotional patterns in normalized-length fake and real headlines. Findings reveal that heightened arousal at the beginning and end of headlines correlates with lower credibility in health news, while a positive valence at the start of gossip news headlines suggests greater rates of being real news. Implications: Highlighting the role of arousal in news veracity. Arousal and valence are distinct dimensions of emotion. Previous research mainly focused on the contribution of valence to veracity and rarely investigated the relationship between arousal and information veracity. This research provided arousal and valence profiles for each headline and examined their associations with news veracity. Addressing the location of emotion in headlines. The placement of lies within a disclosure can sometimes reflect a liar‚Äôs thinking process. Previous research mainly focused on the overall emotion reflected in information. The current research took a relative micro-level lens to see the location or distribution of emotion in one piece of information. We innovatively normalized each headline‚Äôs length to the same length to have a uniform understanding of the location of emotion. Proving the importance of emotional language patterns in information veracity. Language patterns have become a popular focus in deception research, whereas the role of emotional patterns is relatively overlooked. The current research addressed this gap by offering a detailed emotional profile within fake and real news headlines.\n¬†\nTitle: Appraisal Shifts in Reappraisal: Observations using Large Language Models\nTime: 10:00-10:15\nAuthors: Uusberg, Andero; Ruder, Deniss; Sirts, Kairit\nAbstract: Reappraisal is a helpful way to regulate emotions that is difficult to describe and model on a mechanistic level. One solution is to characterize reappraisal as a set of shifts along how a situation is appraised along dimensions such as motive relevance, motive congruence, coping potential and the like. We implemented this approach with the help of natural language processing to detect appraisals and their shifts from text. We first established that general purpose large language models such as GPT 4 can recover appraisals from text with accuracies that are similar to purpose-built models and human annotators. Specifically, we asked GPT4 to re-produce appraisal ratings of 1200 texts collected by Troiano, Oberl√§nder, & Klinger (2022). We found that the accuracy of GPT ratings (root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.45 on a 5-point scale relative to human self-ratings) were similar to a transformer-based purpose-built model (RMSE = 1.4, Troiano et al., 2022) as well as to human annotators (RMSE = 1.46). The relative accuracy of models and humans varied between appraisal dimensions and emotions. We then used GPT to detect appraisal shifts in two datasets containing texts written about an emotional event before and after engaging in reappraisal. We found that appraisal shifts detected from text were related to reappraisal success. I will discuss the conceptual implications and potential practical applications of these findings.\n¬†\nTitle: Defining Emotions for Technology: Lessons Learned from Writing a Global Standard for Ethics in Empathic AI\nTime: 10:15-10:30\nAuthors: Bland, Ben; McStay, Andrew\nAbstract: IEEE 7014 is an ethical standard for empathic AI in the late stages of development; it considers ethical issues in relation to technologies that measure, simulate and interact with emotions. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), one of the primary global standards development organisations, initiated the world‚Äôs first series of standards for the ethics of AI, including IEEE 7014 Standard for Ethical considerations in Emulated Empathy in Autonomous and Intelligent Systems. This new standard attempts to establish normative ethical practices for affective computing, ‚Äúemotion AI‚Äù, and other emotion-related technologies. This presentation will address IEEE 7014‚Äôs structure and content, highlighting the challenges faced in its consensus-driven creation by an international expert group. These challenges include: defining scope, and enumerating ethical issues unique to empathic AI; selecting normative references and ethical frameworks, with resultant requirements for ‚Äúethical explainability‚Äù; and aligning with regional cultural values and emerging regulations. Designing the standard involved addressing limitations, risks, responsibilities, and technical requirements, stemming from the subjective nature of emotional models used in empathic systems. Developing IEEE 7014 followed the typical process of major standards organisations, requiring consensus-based drafting with input from a diverse group of international volunteers from academia, industry, and regulatory bodies. This process entails limitations, such as development timelines that are typically too long to keep pace with emerging technologies, and inadequate stakeholder input due to private and proprietary content licensing. Potential improvements for future standards development, as suggested by the standards community, will also be discussed."

The way parents respond to their children‚Äôs emotions is a crucial component of socialization (e.g., Eisenberg et la., 1998). Temporal Interpersonal Systems (TIES; Butler, 2011) models highlight the importance of moment-to-moment emotion dynamics for interpersonal relationships, and these models have been applied more recently to parent-adolescent relationships (see Lougheed, 2020). However, few studies have examined how adolescent perceptions of parental responses to their emotions influence their psychological adjustment. In the present study we strive to answer the following research questions: (1) Do parental responses to adolescent emotions predict internalizing/externalizing problems and prosocial behavior?, and (2) Does adolescent perspective taking moderate these associations at dispositional and moment-to-moment timescales? We hypothesize that positive responses (e.g.¬†validation and interest) will contribute to positive outcomes, greater perspective taking will strengthen these associations, and that moment-to-moment timescales will be more revealing than dispositional measures. Specific emotions during mother-adolescent conflict discussions (N = 120 dyads) were coded using the Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF; Coan & Gottman, 2007), mothers and adolescents reported on adolescents‚Äô internalizing/externalizing problems, prosocial tendencies, and perspective taking concurrently and six months after the conflict discussion. Mothers and adolescents also participated in a video recall task in which adolescents rated how much their mother was unfair/manipulative, hostile/critical, and warm/supportive every 30 seconds across the 8-minute interaction. We will use grid-sequence analysis (Brinberg et al., 2017) to identify patterns of emotion dynamics between mothers and adolescents and path analyses to test hypotheses about longitudinal associations between these emotion dynamics and adolescent adjustment. Implications for applying dynamic methodologies to research on parent-adolescent emotions and how these emotions are perceived by social partners will be discussed.\n¬†\nTitle: Recalcitrant Emotions are Arational at the Moment and Prospectively Rational\nTime: 9:30-9:45\nAuthors: Xiang, Youce\nAbstract: Contra Brady 2009 who argued that recalcitrant emotions are epistemically irrational for a number of counts including incurring unnecessary cognitive, behavioral costs, and priming subjects to self-defeatingly assent to already-rejected belief as well as to invent non-genuine reasons to vindicate their persistence, I argue that recalcitrant emotions are rational for numerous reasons. Inspired by Fodor, Ledoux and Griffiths, I contend that they are first of all of modular nature that possess dissociable neural substrates from higher cognition, so recalcitrant emotions such as fear and anger comprise automatic, independent generation resistant to rational appraisal. It is therefore inappropriate to charge them as irrational; they are at most arational at the moment. Furthermore, following the new pro-emotion consensus, I maintain that the persistence of recalcitrant emotions constructively contributes to the development of human practical rationality that is ecologically situated and constrained, drawing salience and attention to the underlying focus and care of the experiencers. It allows the potential of self-revelation, reinterpretation and belief-revision; such instrumental and prospective value of recalcitrant emotions justify their relentless duration and adds another level of rationality to them.\n¬†\nTitle: Investigating Resilient Emotion Regulation ‚Äì the Role of Emotion Regulation Variability and Emotion Regulation Flexibility\nTime: 9:45-10:00\nAuthors: Zerban, Matthias; Puhlmann, Lara; Yuen, Kenneth; Koval, Peter; Kobylinska, Dorota; Walter, Henrik; T√ºscher, Oliver; Kalisch, Raffael\nAbstract: Recent developments in the field of emotion regulation (ER) suggest no clear distinction of functional and dysfunctional ER strategies. Rather, dynamic deployment of ER strategies has been proposed as a cornerstone of healthy emotion regulation. Recent technological advances allow investigation of such dynamic processes by ecological momentary assessments (EMA) carried out via mobile devices. ER dynamics are commonly separated into ER variability, i.e., variation in use of different ER strategies over time, and ER flexibility, meaning ER variability that is synchronized with situational changes. First evidence from EMA studies confirms the beneficial influence of ER variability. However, the overall field remains understudied. Further, these studies solely focus on momentary negative affect as outcome. Investigating how ER dynamics relate to longer-term outcomes, like resilience, will provide further insight into relevance and scope of these concepts. Here, we investigate the relationships between different ER dynamic measures and psychological resilience in an international multicentre study (N=240), using EMA and questionnaire data, collected over a period of six months. We investigate both within- and between-subject effects of ER dynamics on resilience as outcome, using linear, as well as linear mixed models. We find no link between ER dynamic measures and resilience on between- or within-person level. Negative associations between ER variability measures and negative affect are in line with previous results. Contradictory to theory, flexibility measures show positive associations with negative affect. Our work suggests that ER variability, while being beneficial in the short run, does not seem to have a similar effect on resilience. Further, instead of flexibly applying different strategies across contexts, choosing from rather few strategies might be better-suited to regulate momentary negative affect.\n¬†\nTitle: Associations Between Attentional Disengagement from Distressed Infant Faces and Cortisol Reactivity are Moderated by Depressive Symptoms in Pregnant Women: An Eye-Tracking Study\nTime: 10:00-10:15\nAuthors: Dworschak, Christine\nAbstract: Antenatal depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders and has been linked tolower maternal sensitivity, which in turn has been found to be associated with negative mentalhealth outcomes in children. However, to date the mechanism behind the association betweenantenatal depression and maternal sensitivity is unclear. One potential mechanistic pathway isthe link between maternal sensitivity and stress reactivity. The aim of this study was to closethese gaps in the literature and investigate associations between attentional disengagement fromdistressed infant stimuli and cortisol reactivity in response to a stress test in a sample of pregnantand nulliparous women. N=79 women (n=36 pregnant) completed two eye-tracking tasksexamining disengagement from adult and infant stimuli distress, a stress manipulation task, andfilled out the BDI-II to assess depressive symptoms. Pregnant vs.¬†nulliparous women showed astronger cortisol reactivity in response to the stress test. While no associations were foundbetween attentional disengagement from adult stimuli and cortisol reactivity, we foundsignificant associations among disengagement from infant (vs.¬†adult) stimuli and cortisolreactivity for pregnant (but not nulliparous) participants which was moderated by depressivesymptoms. For pregnant participants with higher (vs.¬†lower) depressive symptoms, slowerdisengagement from distressed infant stimuli predicted stronger cortisol reactivity in responseto acute stress, while the opposite pattern was observed for nulliparous participants. Findingsof this study provide a more fine-grained understanding of the mechanistic pathway betweenantenatal depression and maternal sensitivity and provides important implications forinterventions."

When it comes to affect improvement (i.e., making others feel good) most research has been conducted from either the agent or the target perspective, overlooking the interactive nature of the process. For affect worsening (i.e., deteriorating others‚Äö√Ñ√¥ feelings) the research is even scarcer with many questions remaining as to what strategies and motives drive people‚Äö√Ñ√¥s efforts when engaging in this process. To address the gaps for affect improvement, the first talk will look at romantic couple‚Äö√Ñ√¥s use of co- regulation strategies and their links with attachment, demonstrating that both anxiety and avoidance attachment are linked to lower use of supportive regulation strategies. The second talk will discuss romantic couples‚Äö√Ñ√¥ co-regulation considering whether the target‚Äö√Ñ√¥s perception of regulation strategy moderates the relationship between their situation appraisal and the perceived effectiveness of the regulation attempt. To address the gaps for affect worsening, the third talk will present a new scale to measure the strategies of engagement and rejection and the findings considering cross-cultural and developmental differences. The fourth talk will address the links between affect worsening motives and strategies relying on intensive longitudinal data, with preliminary findings suggesting that while altruistic motives are associated with engagement strategies, counter-hedonic motives are linked to both engagement and rejection strategies. Finally, the fifth presentation will discuss the link between the dark triad and the motives and strategies in interpersonal emotion regulation.\n\n\nTitle: Avoidant Attachment Predicts Lower Use of High-Engagement Strategies to Regulate a Partner‚Äôs Emotions.\nTime: 14:45-15:00\nAuthors: Carolyn MacCann, Kit S. Double, & Rebecca T. Pinkus\nAbstract: Prior research has shown that both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance relate to the strategies people use to regulate their own emotions. Despite the obvious interpersonal relevance, no research has yet examined the association of adult attachment dimensions with the strategies people use to regulate their partner‚Äôs emotions. Using longitudinal actor-partner independence models, the current study examines whether attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance (and their interaction) predict the use of eight emotion regulation strategies over a two-year period (7 measurement points at T0, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months). Participants were 534 heterosexual couples recruited from Prolific (of which 178 dyads were available at 24 months). Both actor effects and partner effects were stronger for attachment anxiety than attachment avoidance. For actor effects: a) avoidance significantly predicted lower use of receptive listening and valuing to regulate a partner for both men and women, and also predicted lower direction action, reappraisal and humor for women only, and b) anxiety had no significant effects for men but predicted lower listening, reappraisal, and direct action for women. For partner effects: a) avoidance significantly predicted lower receptive listening, valuing and humor for men, and lower expressive suppression and humor for women, and b) anxiety significantly predicted lower valuing for women, but greater listening but lower humor for men. This research clearly shows that attachment relates not just to how you regulate your own emotions, but also how you regulate your partner (actor effects) and how your partner regulates you (partner effects).\n¬†\nTitle: Situational Influences on Emotion Regulation Strategies Among Romantic Partners\nTime: 15:00-15:15\nAuthors: Sarah A. Walker, Rebecca, T. Pinkus, Carolyn MacCann\nAbstract: People in romantic relationships frequently make attempts to regulate each other‚Äôs emotions (known as extrinsic emotion regulation). The current study examines: a) how situation appraisals influence which regulation strategies people use to regulate their partner‚Äôs (target‚Äôs) emotions, b) how the target‚Äôs situation appraisals influence their perceived effectiveness of the regulation attempt and c) whether the target‚Äôs perception of regulation strategy moderates the relationship between their situation appraisal and the perceived effectiveness of the regulation attempt. In this study, 150 couples (300 individuals) were recruited from Prolific and reported on a recent emotional situation from the perspective of either: a) the target (whose partner tried to regulate their emotions) or b) the regulator (who tried to regulate their partner‚Äôs emotions). The target‚Äôs text description of a recent emotional situation was sent to the regulator to ensure that both members of the dyad were responding to the same situation. Both target and regulator rated: a) 4 situation appraisals (challenge, control-self, control-others, and uncontrollability), b) how much the regulator used 8 strategies (expressive suppression, downward comparison, distraction, direct action, humor, positive reappraisal, receptive listening, and valuing), and c) the perceived effectiveness of the regulation attempt. By examining both partners‚Äô perspectives and controlling for relationship length, this study aims to advance the understanding of dyadic emotion co-regulation. Expected results and potential implications for dyadic emotion regulation within romantic relationships will be explored.\n¬†\nTitle: Interpersonal Affect Worsening Scale (IAWS): Development and Validation of a New Questionnaire to Assess Regulation Strategies.\nTime: 15:15-15:30\nAuthors: Shayne Polias, Bel√©n L√≥pez-P√©rez, Antonio Zuffian√≤, Yuhui Chen, Melissa Lopez Reyes, & Madelene Sta. Maria\nAbstract: Interpersonal emotion regulation, or managing others‚Äô emotions, does not always entail directing others‚Äô feelings to positive states, but also inflicting or upregulating negative emotions. The process of causing others to experience unpleasant emotions is called interpersonal affect worsening. The relative lack of research on interpersonal affect worsening can partly be due to the limited assessment tool that can delineate between the regulation strategies to achieve it. Therefore, this research focused on the development of the interpersonal affect worsening scale (IAWS), a tool that aimed to measure strategies for interpersonal affect worsening. Drawing upon the Interpersonal Affect Classification (Niven et al., 2009), the items and scenarios were generated based on the examples of real-life experiences. Three studies were conducted to establish the factor structure, reliability, construct, and criterion validity. In addition, a measurement invariance tests were done where responses from four different groups (United Kingdom and Philippines; younger adult and older adult) to evaluate the applicability of IAWS in different groups. Findings suggested two regulation strategies, engagement, and rejection, that demonstrated unique associations with different constructs. The findings contribute to the limited empirical evidence on the process of affect worsening suggesting important cultural and age differences in the use of strategies. Therefore, this opens the door to further studies to better understand what social contexts may make certain regulation strategies more prevalent and what variables in the lifespan may account for changes in strategy use.\n¬†\nTitle: Exploring the Temporal Dynamics of Motives and Strategies in Daily Interpersonal Affect Worsening\nTime: 15:30-15:45\nAuthors: Yuhui Chen, Bel√©n L√≥pez-P√©rez\nAbstract: Prior studies (e.g., L√≥pez-P√©rez et al., 2017; Netzer et al., 2015) have identified individuals‚Äô tendencies to upregulate others‚Äô negative emotions, labelled as Interpersonal Affect Worsening (IAW). These investigations, however, are limited to experimental environments and have not explored the temporal relationship between motives and strategies in daily life. This research investigates the association between the motives of IAW (altruistic versus counter-hedonic) and the strategies (engagement versus rejection). Additionally, we will examine the role of sympathy. Our current sample consists of 91 participants (mean age = 19.37; 79% female). They were involved in a week-long ecological momentary assessment, in which they reported 3 times a day whether they engaged in IAW, their relationship with the target, their motives, and strategies. Analysis revealed a significant within-person spillover between engagement and altruistic motive (Œ≤ = .16; 95% CI: .009, .296). At the between level, we found a significant correlation between the intercepts (r =.97; 95% CI: [.759, .990]). Intriguingly, altruistic motive did not predict rejection (Œ≤ = .317; 95% CI: -.133, 1.454) or vice versa (Œ≤ = .37; 95% CI: -.262, 3.195). Counter-hedonic motive demonstrated significant spillover with both engagement (Œ≤ = .29; 95% CI: .003, .51) and rejection (Œ≤ = .263; 95% CI: .056, .486), and predicted higher use of rejection (Œ≤ = .105; 95% CI: .013, .206). Our study illuminates the temporal dynamics between motives and regulation strategies in IAW. While altruistic motive predominantly correlates with engagement, counter-hedonic AW shows a broader association with both engagement and rejection."

Departing from the predominant emphasis on strategies dedicated to mitigating negative emotions within existing research and theories on emotion regulation, our intention is to spotlight innovative research that challenges established assumptions. The presentations will cover a broad method spectrum, spanning from physiological measures of controlled inhibition of laughter and their associated neural underpinnings, to the choice of strategies employed in the everyday regulation of positive emotions and its relationship with well-being. In addition, we demonstrate that personality plays a role in the search for positive experiences even from negative sources and explore how self- regulatory processes may moderate engagement in tasks of various difficulty. Furthermore, we will cover influences of external positive and negative feedback on conflict monitoring processes and how emotion regulation and cognitive control interact. By creating connections between different research areas of positive emotion regulation and applying a multimethodological approach, this symposium aims to pave the way for a more unified and holistic understanding of emotion regulation.\n\n\nTitle: Between Laughter and Restraint: Inhibition and Contagious Laughter During Humoristic Experiences\nTime: 14:45-15:00\nAuthors: Vanessa Mitschke, Annika Ziereis, Anne Schacht\nAbstract: Laughter has a crucial function in fostering social connections and alleviating adverse emotions but can take an intriguing shift when a person tries to suppress it. To examine the outcomes and mechanisms of laughter suppression, we performed three experiments. In Experiment 1, participants listened to stimuli containing humorous material (jokes) and were instructed to control their laughter using two emotional regulation techniques: expressive suppression (ES) and cognitive reappraisal (CR). Experiment 1‚Äôs results indicated a significant decrease in facial expressions and amusement when employing CR compared to unrestricted listening. In contrast, ES wholly suppressed smiling, especially for slightly to moderately amusing jokes. It should be noted that very funny jokes were difficult to suppress in all conditions. Experiment 2 investigated the effects of laughter mimicry and social appraisal on humor suppression by complementing the jokes with pre-recorded laughter videos. Suppressing laughter mimicry was extremely difficult, particularly after being exposed to humorous material. Additionally, the presence of laughter from others simultaneously increased the perceived amusement of the material. It is worth noting that although ES did not decrease enjoyment (Exp. 1), attempting to suppress laughter while others were laughing resulted in a significant decrease in amusement (Exp. 2). To further explore the neural correlates of suppressing a smile, Experiment 3 tested inhibition-related ERPs in a go/no-go paradigm. We analyzed the no-go N2 and P3 under two conditions: with and without jokes and further contrasted the independent sources of withholding a smiling and a keypress response.\n¬†\nTitle: Feeling Pleasure after Experiencing Pain: Self-Regulation in Benign Masochism\nTime: 15:00-15:15\nAuthors: Karolina Dyduch-Hazar, Vanessa Mitschke,\nAbstract: Some people, more than others, seek enjoyment from imposing venial harm on themselves such as eating horrendously spicy foods, getting painful tissue massages, or even visiting interactive haunted houses. But do such aversive experiences factually make masochistic individuals feel good? In two studies we sought to answer this question. In a series of trials, participants were given an option to choose the desired stimuli from four different video clip categories corresponding to adequate levels of valence (positive vs.¬†negative) and arousal (high vs.¬†low). After watching each video clip, participants reported how they currently felt. In Study 1, benign masochism was associated with greater preference for stimuli characterized by high arousal and negative valence. High benign masochists reported greater positive affect after exposure to such repulsive stimuli than low benign masochists. Study 2 replicated these findings while controlling for sensation seeking. Our findings demonstrate that some individuals self-regulate through exposure to everyday repellent experiences. They also highlight the utility of the benign masochism in examining contrahedonic motives in self-regulation.\n¬†\nTitle: Self-Regulation Strategies in Young Adults: Challenges and Benefits of Affective Feedback and Task Difficulty\nTime: 15:15-15:30\nAuthors: Guillermo Recio, √Ängel Blanco, Sebastian Korb, Rafael Valenzuela, Jos√© V. Pestana, Nuria Codina\nAbstract: We investigated challenges and benefits of affective feedback and task difficulty on performance, emotional state, motivation, and cognitive control and feedback processing in the brain, measured by means of event-related potentials. Seventy participants completed two different tasks. First, a Flanker task with three types of affective feedback to performance showing either: 1) only positive facial expressions (happy supervisors); 2) positive (happy supervisors to hits) and negative expressions (angry supervisors to errors); or 3) only negative expressions (angry supervisors). We predicted a trade- off between cognitive control and emotion regulation, namely, negative feedback would have a negative impact overall by inducing negative emotion and weakening task engagement. Positive feedback should have a positive impact on mood and motivation but may lead to loosening cognitive control. We hence expected a smaller Flanker effect, enhanced conflict monitoring (N2/P3), and feedback processing (FRN) when receiving both positive and negative feedback from the supervisors (2), compared with always receiving a positive (1) or negative feedback (3). Preliminary results confirmed a clear benefit on mood and motivation associated with positive feedback. The second task was a random motion task with three levels of difficulty (easy, moderate, hard), and tested the hypothesis that moderate difficulty would have positive effects in mood state and task engagement, as it would be challenging but achievable. Preliminary results revealed a benefit for the easy condition instead. Finally, we investigated whether positive emotion reverted benefits in performance in both tasks, taking individual differences in self-regulation (i.e., learning from errors, perseverance) as a covariate.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotion Regulation Choices in Positive and Negative Situations: An Ecologically Valid Approach using Experience Sampling.\nTime: 15:30-15:45\nAuthors: Anna Fischer, Anne Schacht\nAbstract: How we regulate our emotions is essential for our well-being and social relationships. Emotion regulation (ER) is a highly complex, adaptive, and dynamic process and can occur in any type of situation. While research traditionally focused on ER strategies in negative situations, the regulation of emotions in positively perceived situations has often been overlooked. This study addresses this gap by examining ER choices in both positive and negative situations, recognizing the importance of a comprehensive understanding of ER across various contexts. Hereby, the complexity and spontaneity of real-life situations provide a more accurate representation of encountered situations and the corresponding ER strategies employed. Therefore, we implemented an experience sampling study using a smartphone application. 100 participants were asked randomly five times per day for two to four weeks if an emotional situation occurred. For each reported situation, participants provided insights into its context, motivation for regulation, the employed ER strategy, and perceived success in regulating their emotions. Self-reports on well-being and mental health were collected separately. Preliminary analyses suggest that refraining from regulation or extending the duration of emotions in positive situations may play a beneficial role in well-being. The findings from this research contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of emotion regulation across diverse positive and negative situations, shedding light on the potential impact of ER choices in positively perceived contexts on mental health and well-being.\n¬†\nTitle: Discussion\nTime: 15:45-16:00\nAuthors: Ziereis, Annika"

Emotions can also influence characteristics of interpersonal processes and relationships, and support relationship building. Using dyadic paradigms and experience sampling designs, the research presented in this symposium aims to improve the understanding of how emotions and emotional competencies shape, and are shaped by, interpersonal coordination and social exchange processes. The first presentation addresses adult-age and valence differences in interpersonal motor following (i.e., aligning one‚Äö√Ñ√¥s own body movements with those of another person) in emotionally meaningful conversations at zero acquaintance. The second talk focuses on how one person‚Äö√Ñ√¥s motor following affects the interaction partner‚Äö√Ñ√¥s transparent self-disclosure during conversations about positive and negative personal experiences. The third speaker investigates interdependencies between romantic partners‚Äö√Ñ√¥ emotion recognition skills in old age, examining the role of both individual and dyadic variables in this regard. The fourth talk presents research from a 21-day experience sampling study examining orgasm communication and orgasm pursuit goals as predictors of self-reported sexual satisfaction and orgasm occurrence in heterosexual adults. The fifth presentation examines adult-age differences in the functionality of negative emotionality during sad or conflictual couple conversations. Together, these talks illustrate the interpersonal nature of emotional experiences and competencies and highlight their relevance for social relationships.\n\n\nTitle: Examining Adult-Age Differences in Interpersonal Motor Coordination Between Strangers\nTime: 14:45-15:00\nAuthors: Jenny Jaquet, Alissa von Gro√ümann, Antje Rauers, Elisabeth S. Blanke, Uwe Altmann, & Michaela Riediger\nAbstract: Interpersonal motor following (IMF; i.e., aligning one‚Äôs own body movements with those of another person) has been found to be more pronounced when people interact with persons whom they like or with whom they wish to build a relationship. Consequently, it is considered a behavioral expression of social motivation. Developmental theories maintain that this social motivation changes across the lifespan. With increasing adult age, people may increasingly prioritize close relationships over peripheral contacts and new relationships. Therefore, we hypothesized IMF to be less frequent and of shorter duration in older, compared to younger adults, when interacting with a stranger. We analyzed videos of N = 104 dyadic conversations about emotionally meaningful events among unacquainted younger (20-31 years) and older women (69-80 years). IMF indices were quantified using computer- based algorithms (Altmann, 2013). We found that older adults, on average, followed their partner‚Äôs movements for a shorter amount of time than younger adults. The frequency of IMF intervals was higher among age-homogenous than age-heterogenous dyads. Both IMF indices were more pronounced during positively (vs.¬†negatively) valanced conversations. Our findings contribute to understanding how age and valence shape interpersonal coordination in emotionally meaningful conversations at zero acquaintance.\n¬†\nTitle: Follow Me and I Will Tell You More: Associations Between Interpersonal Motor Following and Self-Disclosure\nTime: 15:00-15:15\nAuthors: Alissa von Gro√ümann, Jenny Jaquet, Antje Rauers, Andrea Schlesier-Michel, Elisabeth S. Blanke, Uwe Altmann, & Michaela Riediger\nAbstract: When telling another person about an emotional experience, the other person may behave in ways that encourages further self-disclosure (Reis & Shaver, 1988). This may extend to nonverbal behavior. For example, research suggests that responsive behavior can be expressed in interpersonal motor following (i.e., the alignment of the responder‚Äôs body movements with the speaker‚Äôs movements). Past research has studied these aspects ‚Äì self-disclosure and motor following ‚Äìseparately. However, both behaviors reflect mutual interest in the other person and may thus facilitate each other. This assumption has not been studied before. Thus, in our study, we hypothesized that the responder‚Äôs motor following is associated with the speaker‚Äôs self-disclosure, with mutually reinforcing effects. To test this, we analyzed videos (N = 104) of dyadic conversations about emotional positive and negative events among younger (20‚Äì31 years) and older (69‚Äì80 years) previously unacquainted women. To compute indices for the responder‚Äôs amount of interpersonal motor following, we performed motion energy and time series analyses (Altmann, 2013). Four independent raters evaluated the speaker‚Äôs self- disclosure (taking into account the inner states as reported by the speaker; ICC = .67 ‚Äì .97). Actor- partner interdependence models show that the responder‚Äôs motor following was not associated with the other person‚Äôs self-disclosure. However, one‚Äôs own motor following was associated with one‚Äôs own self-disclosure. This suggests that motor following and self-disclosure are common reflections of one‚Äôs engagement with the conversation. We discuss the role of objective indices versus subjective perceptions of motor following for interpersonal outcomes.\n¬†\nTitle: Individual and Dyadic Correlates of Emotion Recognition Performance in Older Couples\nTime: 15:15-15:30\nAuthors: Beyza S√∂nmez, Elisa Weber, & Gizem H√ºl√ºr\nAbstract: Research has widely documented that the ability to recognise facial emotion expressions from pictures declines in old age. In the current study, we examine how emotion recognition performance is related to different cognitive abilities and self-report measures, such as empathy and relationship satisfaction, in older individuals and couples. In the current study, we use data from 151 older couples (average age = 72.6 years) who took part in assessments of the cognitive abilities of fluid and crystallized intelligence, processing speed, memory, and completed tests of emotion recognition from pictures and short videos. Self-report measures analysed in this study included measures of empathy and relationship satisfaction. Associations between tests of cognitive abilities and emotion recognition were addressed in a confirmatory factor analysis. A model including separate latent factors for fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, processing speed, memory functioning and emotion recognition showed a good model fit. Older participants scored lower on all cognitive functioning tasks, except on tasks for crystallized intelligence. Covariances revealed that emotion recognition performance is significantly related to all cognitive abilities within individuals, but not between partners. Emotion recognition performance was correlated across partners. There were no sex differences in emotion recognition. Emotion recognition was unrelated to self-reported empathy and relationship satisfaction. Taken together, our findings suggest that cognitive ability is the closest correlate of emotion recognition performance from images of facial expression in older adults.\n¬†\nTitle: Love to Love You: Orgasm Communication and Sexual Pleasure Equity Through an Interdependence Lens\nTime: 15:30-15:45\nAuthors: Cheryl L. Carmichael, & Carly Wolfer\nAbstract: In heterosexual partnered sex men are significantly more likely to experience orgasm than women. Explanations for the ‚Äúorgasm gap‚Äù have traditionally centered women‚Äôs psychological and biological deficits and fail to consider the inherently interpersonal nature of partnered sex. We apply interdependence theory to examine how both partners‚Äô orgasm pursuit goals contribute to orgasm occurrence and sexual pleasure. Heterosexual partnered adults (N=128 individuals; 50% men; 18 to 40 years old; relationship length = 3 months to 5 years) completed our mixed-methods 21-day experience sampling study of their sexual encounters. Multilevel models revealed that men reported higher levels personal orgasm pursuit (pursuing my own orgasm) and perceived partner orgasm pursuit (perceptions that my partner is pursing my orgasm) than women. When entered simultaneously, perceived partner orgasm pursuit uniquely predicted orgasm occurrence and sexual satisfaction over and above personal orgasm pursuit. Moreover, perceived partner pursuit amplified the effect of personal orgasm pursuit on sexual satisfaction. Participants also rated the extent to which they and their partner communicated their desire to orgasm, and we coded their open-ended descriptions of how they, and their partner, communicated about their orgasm desires for cue type (verbal/nonverbal). Only the degree to which participants communicated their orgasm desire predicted perceived partner orgasm pursuit, orgasm occurrence, and sexual satisfaction; the use of verbal and nonverbal cues did not. This work reveals how orgasm communication may be able to prompt interpersonal orgasm pursuit and emphasizes the importance of adopting a dyadic perspective for understanding and addressing sexual pleasure inequity.\n¬†\nTitle: Let‚Äôs Talk, Honey! Age Differences in Emotional Experiences During Sad and Conflictual Couples‚Äô Conversations\nTime: 15:45-16:00\nAuthors: Margund K. Rohr, Nicola Ngombe, Philipp Kanske, & Ute Kunzmann\nAbstract: Theories of emotional aging paint a rosy picture by pointing to age-related gains in emotional experience and emotion regulation, especially in close relationships such as couples. A common paradigm here is conflict discussion, in which older couples show less negative affect, report more affection, and display greater cohesion than younger couples. Accordingly, age-related gains are often understood prohedonically, neglecting that the functionality of negative emotions depends on the context. Specifically, while expressing negative emotions during conflict may threaten the relationship, it signals feelings of understanding and togetherness during comforting conversations. In addition, there is evidence for greater context-dependency in old age, which needs to be further explored. In an ongoing study, we ask younger (currently n = 60 dyads, 18 - 35 years old) and older couples (currently n = 20 couples, 55 years and older) to talk about a sad and a conflictual topic in their relationship. Preliminary results show similarities and differences in the emotional experiences of younger and older couples in both contexts. Specifically, while younger couples experience more negative affect during conflict than their older counterparts, we find no age differences in negative emotional experience during comforting situations. Results are discussed in light of prominent theories and implications for future research are drawn."

Motives for Reading Negative COVID-19 News\nTime: 14:45-15:00\nAuthors: Niehoff, Esther; Mittenb√ºhler, Maximilian; Oosterwijk, Suzanne\nAbstract: The COVID-19 pandemic confronted individuals with a slew of negative news. But what drives people to either engage or not engage with news that can be distressing or frightening? The presented research examined how predicted psychological consequences of reading COVID-19 news explained people‚Äôs decisions to read or not read. To that end, we asked participants to choose whether they wished to read COVID-19 news articles based on headlines. The headlines indicated that the articles either contained fact-based information about the pandemic or stories about personal experiences with COVID-19. The headlines were subsequently rated on a set of motivational dimensions, such as ‚Äúreading this article is my moral duty‚Äù. To ensure robustness of findings, we implemented a cross-validation approach. This gave support for four preregistered hypotheses: Choosing to read negative COVID-19 news was positively predicted by (a) the expected acquisition of knowledge; (b) the perceived relevance to one‚Äôs own personal situation; (c) one‚Äôs sense of moral obligation, and (d) the extent to which the story in question focused on personal as opposed to fact-based information. Based on exploratory analyses, we also found suggestive support that anticipated compassion positively predicted choice to read negative COVID-19 news, and that a sense of inappropriateness, and the anticipated gratitude for one‚Äôs own situation, negatively predicted choice. Furthermore, we found a quadratic relationship between feelings and choice, where both the anticipation of weak or no feelings, and the anticipation of strong feelings, negatively predicted choice to read negative news. Taken together, these findings reinforce the idea that engaging with negative content provides informational and social value to the individual.\n¬†\nTitle: The Impact of Emotions and Media Coverage on Behavior Change in the Climate Crisis\nTime: 15:00-15:15\nAuthors: Stoll-Kleemann, Susanne\nAbstract: Emotions are found among the strongest predictors of climate change mitigation and adaptation behaviour. Therefore, to understand the many causes of persistent and undesirable climate-altering behaviours, it is necessary to focus on emotions and emotion-regulation strategies. Complementary to previous studies investigating the isolated influence of media or emotions, we focus on the influence of generalised emotions established via frequent media coverage. We discuss the relevant emotions and the role of the media underlying the motivations of individuals to behave in a less carbon-emitting manner. In a German quota sample (n=979), we investigate whether commonly used principles of COVID-19 pandemic reporting (regular coverage, focus on victims causing other-suffering and self-condemning emotions) can be strategically applied to climate crisis reporting. We show that the confrontation with information about victims of climate change (e.g., the number of heat-related deaths) resulted in emotional reactions of our participants such as other-suffering (pain, sympathy, worry) and few self-condemning (guilt) emotions. The motivation to reassess one‚Äôs own behaviour and shift the focus to protecting the vulnerable from avoidable plights was triggered. Participants indicated that they would change their behaviour if they were confronted with such information if it is regularly and reliably reported. To elicit emotional responses via experience-based mechanisms, personal stories about how climate change is harming individuals have been identified as a promising way to increase emotional engagement with climate change. By reducing psychological distance to climate change and promoting experiential processing and associative appraisal, narrative-based communication strategies may provide an effective tool to promote low carbon behavior.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotions in Collective Climate Action: A Systematic Literature Review\nTime: 15:15-15:30\nAuthors: Sach, Anna A; Castiglione, Anna; Sisay, Benjamin; Bizzego, Andrea; Esposito, Gianluca; Sauter, Disa; Brick, Cameron\nAbstract: Emotions influence and are influenced by collective climate action. They bring people to protest or organise, and shape the mood of rallies and assemblies. Feelings of empowerment, feeling moved and enthusiasm motivate people to continue, while resignation and burnout can help predict activists leaving the movement. Some climate movements explicitly organise the sharing or expressing of emotions. Understanding the role of these affective processes is relevant for mobilisation and continued engagement. Many studies have analysed emotions and other factors motivating collective climate activism, while less research has focused on sustained climate activism. Systematically reviewing this body of literature, we aim to synthesize the empirical knowledge and identify gaps and biases which can guide future research. Previous reviews of environmental and social psychological papers indicated that psychological scholarship often neglected marginalised communities who are disproportionately affected, which is reflected in a dominance of WEIRD samples and authors. In methodological terms, studies usually relied on cross-sectional quantitative panel samples, whereas causal and qualitative methods are rare. We report an ongoing systematic literature review about the underlying psychological dynamics of collective climate action. We are assessing which psychological factors have emerged as correlates and triggers of collective climate action, and which constructs, methods, samples, socio-cultural contexts and phases of activism have been studied and the relationships found. We expect that this review will shed light, among other psychological aspects, on the affective dynamics involved in collective climate action, to get a more complete understanding of the affective dynamics in place.\n¬†\nTitle: Using Hope-Evoking Media to Increase Emotional Bandwidth and Decrease Stress: A Media Prescription Perspective\nTime: 15:30-15:45\nAuthors: Nabi, Robin; Walter, Nathan; Myrick, Jessica; Dobmeier, Christopher M; Wang, Minghui\nAbstract: Rooted in the broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 1998, 2001), recent research on ‚Äúmedia prescriptions‚Äù has demonstrated that exposure to brief, 3-5 minute video content that evokes hope or amusement over the course of a week can have indirect, salubrious effects on stress in the days that follow (Prestin & Nabi, 2020; Nabi et al., 2022). Although there is some indication that coping efficacy may help to explain this finding, the psychological mechanism(s) through which these lingering effects emerge is not fully specified. This research explores the concept of ‚Äúemotional bandwidth‚Äù as a potential critical mediator. Specifically, we predict that those exposed to inspiring or humorous content will (a) experience the emotions of hope or amusement (respectively). The elevations in these positive emotions will be associated with an increase in perceived emotional bandwidth to cope with stressors, which in turn, will relate to subsequent decreased perceived stress and increased empathy. Data collection is currently underway with a representative sample of 500 US adults. A pretest in Week 1 assesses typical media consumption, personality traits including empathy, stress levels, and emotional bandwidth. During Week 2, each weekday participants will watch a 3-5 minute video that is either inspiring or humorous, listen to a meditation, scroll on their phones, or experience no media content (control group) and report on their felt emotions, stress, and emotional bandwidth in the moment. The following 2 weeks, participants will again report on their stress, emotional bandwidth, empathy as well as any changes in their media habits."

We present results from the validation of a newly developed database of dynamic multimodal expressions, wherein actors convey a large number of emotions through facial, vocal and bodily expressions. A subset of 5,000 recordings was evaluated using both a forced-choice emotion recognition task and an appraisal dimension rating task (e.g., novelty, pleasantness, goal conduciveness, urgency, power). The subset contained recordings from 28 actors (14 F, 14 M) who expressed 44 emotions, each with two levels of emotion intensity (medium, high). In addition, we performed machine learning classification (support vector machines) based on facial action units, head movements and vocal features. Results from human judgments and machine classification showed similar patterns of accuracy for the different emotions, and together suggest that almost all of the 44 emotions could be recognized with better-than-chance-accuracy. The best recognized emotions included determination, concentration, expectation, positive surprise, relief, and amusement for positive emotions; and anger, disgust, boredom, schadenfreude, fear, sarcasm, confusion, and sadness for negative emotions. Results further provide novel information on the perceived appraisal patterns for a wide variety of emotions. Taken together, the findings suggest that nonverbal emotional communication may be more nuanced and flexible than previously thought.\n¬†\nTitle: Does Acceptance Lead to Change? Training in Radical Acceptance Improves Implementation of Cognitive Reappraisal\nTime: 15:00-15:15\nAuthors: Segal, Or; Weinbach, Noam; Aderka, Idan M; Sher, Helene\nAbstract: Third-wave cognitive behavioral treatments such as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) theorize that practicing emotional acceptance can facilitate cognitive change. The goal of the current study was to provide an empirical evidence for this notion by assessing if a two-week online training to cultivate acceptance of negative personal events can subsequently improve the ability to implement cognitive reappraisal while being exposed to aversive stimuli. During six training sessions, 120 healthy individuals recorded personal events from their lives that evoke negative emotions in them. Participants were randomly allocated into three groups: In a Radical Acceptance group, participants implemented a DBT skill aimed to promote acceptance of the negative events they described. In a Check the Facts group, participants reappraised their automatic interpretations of the described events. A Control group described the events, but did not use any DBT skill to cope with them. A picture-based emotion regulation task was used before and after the training to assess implementation of emotional acceptance and cognitive reappraisal. The results showed that following the training, participants who practiced radical acceptance of reality improved in their ability to implement both emotional acceptance and cognitive reappraisal. In contrast, Check the Facts group improved only in the implementation of cognitive reappraisal, but not emotional acceptance. The control group did not improve in either strategy. The findings provide empirical evidence to support the notion that cultivating acceptance can subsequently improve the ability to reinterpret reality for coping adaptively with negative events.\n¬†\nTitle: Can Humans Perceive Emotions Just by Seeing Touching Hand?\nTime: 15:15-15:30\nAuthors: Oya, Rika; Tanaka, Akihiro\nAbstract: We communicate emotions through various nonverbal cues, such as face, voice, and touch. Touch is one of important channels in emotional communication which works differently from the face and voice. Previous studies have investigated the perception of 12 discrete emotions from touch. Results showed that six emotions (anger, fear, disgust, love, gratitude, and sympathy) were communicated in the United States (Hertenstein et al., 2006, Study 1), and three of the six were communicated in Japan (Oya & Tanaka, 2023). Interestingly, Hertenstein et al.¬†(2006) also revealed that five emotions except for gratitude were decoded accurately without the experience of being touched, just by seeing the tactile behavior of the encoder (Study 3). Here, we conduct almost the same experiment as the Study 3 in Hertenstein et al.¬†and examine whether we can perceive emotions just by seeing without feeling touch for Japanese participants. In the experiment, participants were presented with video clips of tactile behavior recorded in Oya and Tanaka (2023). In each video clip, one member of a dyad was assigned the role of encoder, whereas the other member was assigned the role of being decoder. The encoder freely touched the decoder‚Äôs arm with the hand to express each of the 12 emotions. Participants watched these video clips and judged the expressed emotion by the encoder. Results will be discussed in terms of the role of visual and tactile information in emotional communication through touch.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotion Understanding, Emotion Regulation, and Mental Well-Being: Evidence from New Emotion Ability Tests\nTime: 15:30-15:45\nAuthors: Floman, James; Brackett, Marc ; LaPalme, Matthew; Ponnock, Annette; Doyle, Aidan B\nAbstract: Emotion granularity theory (Kashdan et al., 2015) holds that emotion understanding (EU) abilities facilitate targeted emotion regulation (ER) and thereby support mental well-being (MWB). However, existing EU tests tap only a few components of the theorized construct space. To address this gap, we developed three new tests. The Emotion Language Test (ELT) assesses the breath and precision of emotion language across 10 primary emotions employing expert consensus and machine learning-derived scoring from a corpus of 20,000 emotion terms. The Conceptual Emotion Granularity Test (CEGT) measures the specificity of people‚Äôs emotion concept maps (how they organize emotions into sets of mental categories, from a broad view of just positive and negative emotions to a more emotion-specific view). The Core Relational Themes of Emotion (CORE) test gauges knowledge of the central meanings or themes underlying 19 positive and negative emotions (e.g., achievement for pride, loss for sadness). In five validity studies, with demographically diverse working U.S. adults (Ntotal = 2028), we found evidence supporting the structural, convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of the new EU assessments. The EU tests predicted higher ER ability on a performance test (STEM), and healthier MWB, including greater purpose in life and post-traumatic growth, lower compassion fatigue, and a mindset that emotions are malleable versus fixed (absolute rs ranged from .11 to .45, ps&lt;.05). The new tests also showed evidence of incremental validity beyond widely-used EU tools (i.e., the MSCEIT and STEU). Theoretical and methodological contributions will be considered, along with study implications and future research directions.\n¬†\nTitle: Predicting Emotion Regulation Strategies from Aspects of the Social Context in Everyday Life\nTime: 15:45-16:00\nAuthors: Main, Alexandra; Yung, Shun Ting; Chen, Yaoyu; Zawadzki, Matthew\nAbstract: Emotion regulation has traditionally been conceptualized as an intrapersonal phenomenon with a focus on individuals‚Äô subjective experiences. However, emotions occur predominantly in the context of social interactions (Campos et al., 2011), particularly during emerging adulthood when individuals spend more time outside the family home. However, few studies have examined predictors of the use of different emotion regulation strategies in everyday life. Using Ecological Momentary Assessment (4 daily assessments across 14 days), we first examined concurrent associations between social contexts (closeness to interaction partner and pleasantness of interaction) and use of emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) among college students. Second, we used lagged models to investigate potential carryover effects of aspects of the social context on emotion regulation strategy use. Better quality of social interactions was associated with both less suppression and less reappraisal at the same moment (Œ≤ = -.23, p &lt;.001 and Œ≤ = -.20, p &lt;.001 for reappraisal and suppression, respectively), but not at subsequent moments (Œ≤ = .02, p &gt; .05 and Œ≤ = .04, p &gt; .05 for reappraisal and suppression, respectively). Interestingly, we found that reappraisal at one moment predicted more pleasant interactions and closeness at the next moment (Œ≤ = .09, p = .004 and Œ≤ = .09, p = .040 for pleasantness and closeness, respectively). Our findings underscore the importance of understanding both social contexts and emotion regulation on momentary levels. This study holds implications for understanding social context and emotion regulation in the everyday lives of emerging adults."

Yet, assessing these implicit emotional processes has been elusive. We suggest that reinforcement learning (RL) paradigms and models can assess implicit emotional processes related to motivated behavior. In RL paradigms, people make choices between options that lead to pre-specified rewards and punishments, however, it is possible to also estimate the implicit motivational value of the rewards and punishments themselves instead of pre-specifying them. We implemented these new RL models in two tasks: one in which people made choices that predicted the likelihood of whether they would see either familiar or novel negative, neutral, or positive emotional images; and another in which they viewed faces varying in attractiveness. We estimated the implicit motivational value (iMV) of these stimuli and found that, as expected, participants exhibited greater iMV to positive than to negative images and greater iMV to attractive than to less attractive faces. Further, there were only mild correlations between iMV and explicit ratings of these stimuli. These findings demonstrate the extraordinary possibility for using RL models to estimate the iMV of a host of emotional or otherwise motivationally salient stimuli that is clearly separable from explicitly asking participants about their feelings.\n¬†\nTitle: Appraisal of Certainty‚Äôs Effect on Information Processing: Attempted Replications of Tiedens and Linton (2011) Findings.\nTime: 15:00-15:15\nAuthors: Mailliez, M√©lody; Bresson, Thomas; Julia, Katia; Courchamp, Laurine\nAbstract: An extensive body of research has examined the effects of unrelated emotions (incidental emotions) on judgments and decisions through their constituent appraisals. Tiedens and Linton (2001) pioneered research showing that incidental emotions associated with a high degree on the appraisal of certainty (e.g., joy, anger) trigger heuristic processing whereas those associated with a low degree on the appraisal of certainty (e.g., hope, fear) trigger a more deliberative processing. However, several researchers failed to show any mediation of the link between incidental emotions and decisions through the appraisal of certainty. It is then of particular relevance to deepen the role of the appraisal of certainty in such relation since there seems to be a working assumption in much of the field that the certainty appraisal modulates judgments and decisions according to the information processing that is supposed to trigger. In three preregistered studies (Nstudy 1 = 318; Nstudy 2 = 736, Nstudy 3 = 500), we attempted to replicate the seminal results of Tiedens and Linton (2001). We did not find an effect of the appraisal of certainty on judgements and decisions in any of these three studies. Further investigations are then needed to disentangle whether the repeated absence of effects is the consequence of methodological considerations or whether it is necessary to consider other appraisal dimensions as a determinant of information processing triggered by incidental emotions (e.g., appraisal of control or an interaction between certainty and control).\n¬†\nTitle: The Role of Contrast Emotions in Response Inhibition\nTime: 15:15-15:30\nAuthors: Gupta, Rashmi\nAbstract: Previous studies examined the role of irrelevant emotional facial expressions in response inhibition. Irrelevant emotional faces would facilitate or inhibit response inhibition, depending on how these faces are paired with different emotional faces. In previous studies, angry faces were either paired with neutral, happy, or fearful faces in the response inhibition task, potentially leading to mixed results. This is the first study where all four irrelevant emotional faces (happy, angry, fearful, and neutral) were used simultaneously and presented in the same block as a stop signal in the stop signal paradigm. Participants were required to respond to the go signals (discriminate between X and O). Occasionally, a stop signal with irrelevant facial expressions (happy, angry, fearful, or neutral) was presented, where participants were required to withhold their motor response. All stop signals with irrelevant emotional facial expressions in comparison to neutral facial expressions interfered with the response inhibition process. Our results extend previous findings by suggesting that approach and avoidance reactions to facial expressions depend on the contrasting emotions presented in the task. The finding helps explain many inconsistent results with respect to the effect of emotions on response inhibition reported in the literature. It also suggests that the role of valence (emotional vs nonemotional)‚Å† needs to be considered in determining inhibitory control. These results have theoretical implications for understanding the nature of emotions and their interaction with cognitive control functions.\n¬†\nTitle: Artificial Intelligence for Anxiety: Pathways for Transdisciplinary Research on Anxiety Sensitive Artificial Intelligence\nTime: 15:30-15:45\nAuthors: Vanh√©e, Lo√Øs; Borit, Melania\nAbstract: Anxiety is a psychological state raised by uncertainty leading to uncertainty-reducing behaviors (e.g.¬†anticipation, vigilance). Although anxiety typically functions positively by facilitating management of potential threats, excessive or prolonged anxiety threatens human wellbeing and health (anxiety comorbids with severe ailments like depression or phobia), resulting in social costs scaled in trillion euros worldwide annually, from treatment to sick leave and productivity losses. Whereas factors inducing anxiety and resulting from it are often difficult to integrate and also overlooked besides therapeutic praxis, Artificial Intelligence-based technologies provide a critical leverage for enabling a scalable, pragmatic, and systematic accountability of these anxiety factors. We coin these technologies as Anxiety Sensitive Artificial Intelligence (AnxSAI). AnxSAI opens for a broad range of applications, from anticipating and preventing (e.g.¬†in education, work, urban planning) to mitigating and treating anxiety disorders (e.g.¬†individualized precision therapies). Whereas until now AnxSAI has been near-exclusively investigated from computer science perspectives, it is inherently an inter- and transdisciplinary domain of research. The present study develops a framing for the systematic transdisciplinary mapping of AnxSAI research along three interrelated layers. The first layer focuses on foundational concerns: crossing anxiety as a psychological construct within computational methods AI models (e.g.¬†recognition from text, simulation models). The second layer focuses on the social ramifications of AnxSAI, crossing sociology, law, philosophy, ethics, organizational theory, and critical studies. The third layer covers the practical implementation of AnxSAI technologies with societal actors, identifying pathways to achieving positive impact (e.g.¬†relevant stakeholders and their desires and concerns, costs)."

This symposium gathers together scholars who are reconsidering psychological accounts by incorporating ideas from related domains of study to propose new angles on longstanding theoretical issues.  The first paper extends stimulus-driven and appraisal accounts of emotion causation by incorporating goal-directed concepts relating to decision theory and proposes that emotional outcomes depend on evaluation of forward-looking prospects of the utility of alternative action options.  The second paper reports on theoretical developments arising from a cross-disciplinary collaboration involving linguistics, psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience.  The authors argue that relevance theory can clarify how emotions are produced, perceived, and also communicated to other people.  The third paper, led by an anthropologist, extends this relevance-based account into the developmental domain of social learning and seeks to understand the consequences of observing caregiver emotions on children‚Äö√Ñ√¥s allocation of attention to different aspects of the social environment and their appraisals of social value.  The final paper explores the implications of moving beyond intrapsychic processes when seeking to understand and explain the emergence and communication of emotions.  The author argues that cognitive calculations of relevance or expected utility are not the only determinants or regulators of unfolding emotional episodes.  Instead, emotional meanings and actions may consolidate over time during social transactions between people engaged in joint or clashing activities.  The papers will be integrated and critiqued by a discussant who is a philosopher with substantial expertise in the various disciplines contributing to affective science.\n\n\nTitle: Emotions as High-Impact Decisions\nTime: 9:15-9:30\nAuthors: Agnes Moors\nAbstract: Emotions are typically characterized as intense and short-lived, as having a positive or negative valence, as urgent or control-precedent, as difficult to control, and as having an irrational flavor. To explain these features, traditional emotion theories have put forward a stimulus-driven process of emotion causation. This is a process in which the representation of a stimulus (e.g., snake) or stimulus features (e.g., danger) directly activates the representation of a response or action tendency (e.g., flight or defense). Traditional theories place this process in sharp contrast with a goal-directed process, which they hold responsible for instrumental actions and emotion regulation. In a goal-directed process, an action (or strategy) is selected based on a weighing of the expected utilities of the available action options (or strategies). I recently proposed a goal-directed theory, which proposes that most of our so-called emotional episodes rely on the same goal-directed process as that involved in instrumental action. The main difference is that the goals at stake in so-called ‚Äúemotional‚Äù episodes have a higher value than those at stake in so-called ‚Äúnon-emotional, instrumental‚Äù episodes. I explain how this theory can account for the typical and apparent characteristics of emotions (i.e., intense, valenced, urgent, difficult to control, and irrational), and what the implications of this parsimonious view are for the scientific status of the set of emotions itself.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotions and Relevance\nTime: 9:30-9:45\nAuthors: Daniel Dukes, Constant Bonard, Steve Oswald, Tim Wharton, and David Sander\nAbstract: Virtually all affective scientists place relevance (or a related concept) at the heart of their definition of emotion. And yet, a more comprehensive understanding of the notion of relevance within the affective sciences is still needed, particularly when compared to advances in pragmatic linguistics, where the concept of relevance (c.f. relevance theory) is one of the cornerstones. In this presentation, prepared by researchers in psychology, philosophy, neuroscience and linguistics, we will detail two examples concerning emotion recognition to demonstrate how beneficial a comparison of the two conceptions of relevance could be. The first is related to the contextual embeddedness of emotion recognition, while the second is related to the communicative status of emotions. Drawing on relevance theory‚Äôs cognitive model of communication, we point out how understanding whether an expression of emotion was made spontaneously or with a view to communicate something is crucial to a descriptively adequate account of emotion recognition ‚Äì e.g.¬†a parent squinting might be misunderstood as a signal of disapprobation because it is interpreted as intended for communication when it is only a nonintentional expression of puzzlement. We will also discuss relevance and emotion in terms of the ongoing debate between goal-directed vs stimulus-driven processes, suggesting that, during the emotion elicitation process, relevance may lie at the interface between our goals and (internal and external) stimuli. We will conclude that a comparison between the notion of relevance in emotion theory and the concept relevance in relevance theory is worthwhile for the affective sciences and beyond.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotions as Social Processes\nTime: 9:45-10:00\nAuthors: Brian Parkinson\nAbstract: Most psychological theories see emotions as consequences of cognitive and perceptual processes involving appraisals, bodily feedback or some combination of the two and primarily located inside an individual person‚Äôs mental system. Social factors feature in these theories only as indirect influences on these intrapsychic processes. Correspondingly, research into emotion‚Äôs effects on other people often focuses on one-way information transmission that influences appraisals or automatically induced mimicry that triggers feedback processes. In this paper, I explore an alternative view of emotional action and reaction as serving the primary function of aligning people‚Äôs orientations to different aspects of meaningful social contexts. In this view, emotions either emerge from reciprocal adjustments of two or more people engaged in joint activity or from clashes and intersections between interactants‚Äô lines of action. Individuals and groups are also able to modify their emotional course in a strategic or goal-directed manner but are likely to meet resistance and countermoves from the people they are trying to affect. Although individuals need to register each other‚Äôs changing relational positions at some level for these processes to operate, there is no need for them to arrive at any coherent emotional meaning before emotional engagement with the social world can happen. Similarly, both relevance detection and evaluation of intended outcomes can operate as socially distributed processes rather than happening squarely in the minds of each separate individual as preconditions for emotional onset.\n¬†\nTitle: Discussion\nTime: 10:00-10:15\nAuthors: Scarantino, Andrea"

Evidence from cognitive and biological markersTime09:15 - 10:15RoomBann: PFC/0G/024Abstract\n\n\nTitle: The Effect of Alexithymia on Emotion Response Coherence During Positive and Negative Emotions\nTime: 9:15-9:30\nAuthors: Elena Constantinou, Georgia Panayiotou\nAbstract: Alexithymia is a term used to describe a pattern of emotion processing deficits characterized by difficulties in identifying and describing feelings and an externally oriented, concrete thinking style. A hallmark characteristic of alexithymia is a decoupling between different emotional responses, particularly between subjective experience and physiological reactivity. The current study investigated this decoupling hypothesis, by assessing the coherence among subjective experience, physiological arousal and facial expressions during different types of emotional experiences. Eighty- four participants viewed neutral, pleasant and unpleasant film-clips rating continuously their subjective pleasantness using a dial, while skin conductance levels (SCL), heart rate (HR), zygomatic and corrugator activity were recorded. Lagged within person cross-correlations were calculated for each pair of emotion responses to assess coherence during film-viewing. Multi-level models examined the effects of film type and alexithymia levels on coherence. Results showed an effect of alexithymia only on the coherence between skin conductance and subjective experience, with lower coherence at higher alexithymia levels, but only for negative emotions. This effect was mainly driven by the externally-oriented component of alexithymia. Alexithymia had no effects on the coherence of other emotion response pairs. These findings provide further support for a decoupling between emotion responses in alexithymia, but also for the specificity of such deficits, which pertain only to negative emotions and only to the arousal aspect of emotional experiences.\n¬†\nTitle: The Relationship Between Alexithymia and Gut Microbiota in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease\nTime: 9:30-9:45\nAuthors: Luigia Zito, Roberta Lanzara, Chiara Conti, Federico Anaclerio, Konstantinos Efthymakis, Liborio Stuppia, Piero Porcelli\nAbstract: Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, mainly ulcerative colitis and Crohn‚Äôs disease) is a chronic intestinal disease of multifactorial etiology. The role of gut microbiota in IBD is increasingly recognized because of the bidirectional communication with the brain. To date, studies on the association between gut dysbiosis and psychological factors in IBD are few. In our ongoing longitudinal study, we aim to evaluate the relationship between intestinal microbiota and psychological factors, including alexithymia, in IBD patients. Methods: Data are related to a preliminary consecutive sample of 23 treatment-seeking IBD patients with quiescent disease activity. Patients were asked to collect a stool sample at home to evaluate microbiota composition and alteration. Alexithymia (TAS-20), gastrointestinal symptoms (GSRS), IBD health-related quality of life (IBDQ), somatic symptoms (PHQ-12), perceived stress (PSS), and depression and anxiety symptoms (HADS) were concurrently assessed. Results: Within this sample, all patients met criteria for intestinal dysbiosis. Specifically, actinobacteria were highly correlated with PHQ-12, GSRS abdominal pain and bloating, IBDQ gastrointestinal symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional distress, and social functioning (r=.58-.76). Psychological symptoms, including alexithymia, were not correlated with bacterial strains while the DIF alexithymia component correlated significantly with GSRS abdominal pain, IBDQ systemic symptoms and emotional distress (r=. 47-.51). Conclusion: Preliminary, our results suggest that specific gut bacteria (actinobacteria) are associated with somatic symptoms rather than psychological factors, including alexithymia. The possible mediating role of alexithymia between gut microbiota and physical and mental health will be further evaluated by recruiting a larger sample size and using a longitudinal study design.\n¬†\nTitle: Out of Sync: Disrupted Prefrontal Brain Synchronization During Bluffing in Alexithymia\nTime: 9:45-10:00\nAuthors: Malina Misol, Giacomo Costa, Zhihao Wang, Branislava ƒÜurƒçiƒá-Blake, Sander Martens, Andre Aleman, Katharina S. Goerlich\nAbstract: Introduction: Alexithymia is associated with impairments in social cognition and interaction. One component of social interaction is strategic deception, e.g., bluffing in negotiations or poker games. Here, we hypothesized that prefrontal interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) would be disrupted in pairs of alexithymic (TAS-20 score ‚â• 61) and lexithymic individuals (AL pairs) compared to pairs of two lexithymic players (LL pairs). Methods: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning was used to simultaneously measure medial prefrontal IBS in 30 LL and 30 AL pairs during rest, and during bluffing versus honest decisions in a poker game. Additionally, personality assessments were conducted between alexithymia facets, anxiety, depression, and ‚Äòdark triad‚Äô personality traits. Results: Initial results from 39 pairs (23 AL) revealed higher-resting state IBS in LL versus AL pairs. AL pairs exhibited significantly reduced task IBS during bluffing than LL pairs. Moreover, alexithymic individuals scored higher on psychopathy, Machiavellianism, depression, and anxiety than lexithymic individuals. Partial correlations controlling for depression and anxiety identified specific correlations between DDF and Machiavallianism, and DIF and psychopathy. Conclusions: Alexithymia is associated with disrupted prefrontal brain synchronization during strategic deception, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying impairments in social cognition and interaction.\n¬†\nTitle: Alexithymia Moderates Salience Effects in Emotional Facial Expression Perception and Recognition\nTime: 10:00-10:15\nAuthors: Marine Mas, Olivier Luminet\nAbstract: Introduction: Emotional salience affects cognition and contributes to adaptive emotion regulation. However, the moderating impact of alexithymia on emotional salience perception remains poorly understood. Following deficit models of alexithymia, salience perception might favor emotional processing by acting as a clue and helping individuals counter their emotional perception deficits. According to over-responding models, emotional salience might activate protective avoidance mechanisms and deteriorate performance in presence of emotional information. Methods: Emotional facial expression pictures were created from the DynaFACES Database (videos depicting actors‚Äô faces morphing from neutral to emotional facial expressions). Ninety-four participants evaluated 160 pictures of happy, disgusted, fearful, angry and sad faces at various intensities (40%, 60%, 80%, 100%) and completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Outcome variables were arousal ratings, valence ratings, and correct emotion recognition. Results: We found a morphing intensity by alexithymia interaction, which was explained by higher arousal ratings and better emotion recognition for emotional faces at 40% morphing intensity for people scoring higher on alexithymia. No interaction effects morphing intensity by alexithymia were observed for the higher morphing intensities. Conclusions: Higher TAS-20 total scores only predicted higher emotional responses at lower emotional salience intensity, which may then contribute to better recognition of emotional facial expressions. People with higher alexithymia can extract meaningful information to correctly recognize emotion when emotional information is the least available, supporting the over-responding model of alexithymia."

Studying these emotions and how they change when people adapt to those events lies at the heart of people‚Äôs well-being. Current emotion measures are not ideal for such studies. Most measures are based on retrospective questions of how frequently people experience certain emotions. The emergence of experience sampling methods (ESM) has greatly improved our possibilities for studying emotional development and change. However, these methods often still rely on a very limited, preselected set of default emotion terms that do not necessarily capture how people describe their own emotions and what they feel in daily life. We investigate emotional adaptation by asking people to describe in their own words, which emotions are experienced as well as how these emotions are related to well-being. In an ESM study participants report their emotional experiences in a free way with open-ended questions without being limited by multiple choice items. Also, we look into their well-being via short, close-ended items. We present and discuss the initial findings of this study. This study would help get a better understanding of people‚Äôs emotional adaptation: what emotions are experienced in everyday life, in which contexts, and at which well-being levels. Emotion labels received in this study will be a useful ground for future ESM studies.\n¬†\nTitle: Diversity in Everyday Experiences of Emotion: A Natural Language Approach\nTime: 9:30-9:45\nAuthors: Katie Hoemann\nAbstract: Research on diversity in emotion examines the range and balance of emotions experienced in the moment and over time, to date linking these to positive real-world outcomes such as fewer mental and physical health symptoms, as well as greater social cognitive and wise reasoning abilities. To measure diversity, participants are commonly asked to rate sets of pre-specified emotions. This approach overlooks the richness and nuance of everyday experiences of emotion, potentially obscuring individual and situational differences therein. Bringing natural language to bear on diversity can clarify whether key findings extend to spontaneously-generated emotion words. We address this need through secondary analysis of studies that have asked participants to freely label or describe their emotional experiences over the course of several weeks. This innovative approach allows us to observe the emotion words used and how they may fluctuate in daily life contexts. Using these proof-of-concept data, we evaluate how lexical estimates of diversity in emotion are associated with relevant outcomes (e.g., momentary affect, self-reported depression and anxiety). We discuss these initial results in terms of their consistency with the existing literature and their implications for future research ‚Äì including a larger ongoing study in which participants verbally describe their current experiences four times a day for 70 days. We conclude by considering how we sample and define language for emotion and how we understand the role of diversity in promoting health.\n¬†\nTitle: The Granularity of Good: Distinguishing Positive Emotional Experiences\nTime: 9:45-10:00\nAuthors: Roza Kamiloƒülu\nAbstract: What does it mean to feel good? This research investigates the distinct nature of positive emotions through a semantic space analysis of personal narratives. We questioned whether different types of positive experiences, such as the awe of natural beauty or the thrill of a sports victory, are fundamentally unique. To explore this, we collected and computationally analyzed 3,592 instances of 22 positive emotions from 165 individuals. Our method involved unsupervised clustering to identify distinct patterns within these narratives, with the goal of maximizing internal consistency and distinctiveness among emotional categories. This technique allowed us to establish clear inter-cluster differences and intra-cluster similarities, indicating that each cluster was both unique from the others and consistent within itself. The analysis yielded four emotions ‚Äî amusement, interest, lust, and tenderness ‚Äî that each formed their own cluster, suggesting they are uniquely experienced. By applying semantic space analysis to in-depth personal emotional narratives, this research enhances our understanding of positive emotions and contributes to the refinement of emotion taxonomies. The insights gained hold implications for advancing psychological research methodologies and enriching the practice of psychological assessment.\n¬†\nTitle: How Do People Decide How They Feel? Response Processes in Experience Sampling Method Studies\nTime: 10:00-10:15\nAuthors: Leonie Schorrlepp\nAbstract: Emotions play a central role in our functioning. A prominent way for the assessment of emotions is the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). Due to technological advances of the past decades, ESM research is booming among researchers and clinicians and is now commonly used to study dynamics in emotions. To justify the use of ESM to study emotions in research and clinical practice, valid measurements are crucial. However, recently concerns have been voiced regarding the validity of emotion assessments using ESM. In particular, research suggests that participants apply different response processes to decide on their answers, making intra-individual and inter-individual comparison difficult. That is, for the question ‚Äòhow sad are you right now‚Äô on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much), a ‚Äò4‚Äô may often carry different meaning for different participants and even for the same one at different points in time. During the presentation, we will share initial results of a mixed-methods investigation into response processes during emotion assessment, combining ESM and qualitative interviewing techniques. During the study, participants rated their emotions five times per day across 28 days of ESM. We also asked participants to reflect on their rating choices in the moment using open-ended data. Additionally, we conducted several semi-structured and cognitive interviews during the 28-day period to get a more detailed insight into participants‚Äô response processes. We will present answering profiles derived from our analysis of these interviews to illustrate that intra- and interindividually inconsistent response processes are indeed present, posing to the validity of ESM data.\n¬†\nTitle: Discussion\nTime: 10:15-10:30\nAuthors: Erba‚âà√º, Yasemin"

(Experienced) social environments, particularly peer contexts, play a crucial role in shaping how adolescents regulate their emotions. Yet, a gap persists in understanding the dynamics of emotions within specific peer contexts. Peer affiliation and peer status are two important and distinct factors that might influence adolescents‚Äô emotion regulation (ER). Therefore, this study examined to what extent peer status and peer affiliation affect the relationship between the use of (positive and negative) ER strategies, and positive (PA) and negative affect (NA) in adolescents‚Äô daily life. Dutch adolescents attending pre-vocational education reported on their momentary positive and negative affect, and ER of both positive affect and negative emotions (i.e., rumination, expression, sharing) 3 times per day for a 14-day period. Results highlight the interplay between peer dynamics, ER strategies, and both PA and NA. This study provides valuable insights into the contextual factors influencing adolescent emotional experiences.\n¬†\nTitle: The Link Between Need Frustration and Empathic Accuracy in Romantic Relationships\nTime: 9:30-9:45\nAuthors: Scharmer, Aurelia Lilly; Stas, Lara; Ickes, William; Verhofstadt, Lesley\nAbstract: The frustration of relational needs, encompassing relatedness, autonomy, and competence, is a major driver of conflicts in romantic relationships. Relational need frustration has been negatively associated to multiple key relationship processes, including conflict resolution. Despite abundant research suggesting that need frustration might also undermines empathic accuracy, the ability to infer another person‚Äôs thoughts and feelings accurately (i.e., to perceive another person‚Äôs thoughts and feelings in a manner consistent with the way they experience and report them), this association has never been tested empirically. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that during couples‚Äô conflict interaction, need frustration and empathic accuracy are negatively associated within the same person. To this end, we analyzed data from a lab-based conflict interaction study, including a video-mediated recall task. Using an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model, we found that women‚Äôs need frustration, but not men‚Äôs, was negatively linked to their own empathic accuracy during couple conflict. An exploratory analysis of the partner effects revealed a positive association between men‚Äôs level of need frustration and women‚Äôs empathic accuracy during couple conflict. These findings highlight the importance of taking need frustration into account‚Äïby researchers and clinicians‚Äïwhen trying to understand and enhance relational well-being.\n¬†\nTitle: Failed Empathy Interventions\nTime: 9:45-10:00\nAuthors: Tagesson, Alexander; P√§rnamets, Philip; Wallin, Annika\nAbstract: We empathize when doing so aligns with our underlying motives and avoid empathy when it hinders fulfilment of these motives. Recently, leading empathy researchers have tried to get people to become more empathic, and more pro-social, by using motivated empathy interventions. In our study, we create an interventions competition, using previously published interventions, to test which interventions increase motivation to empathize and prosociality in both an in- and outgroup context. Using self-report- and behavioral measures, participants reported how much empathy they felt with someone suffering from poverty and was offered to make a real-life monetary donation to poverty prevention and help the suffering person. Our results suggest that interventions designed to increase motivation to empathize do not perform better than a control intervention. Interventions did not get participants to become more empathic or pro-social; importantly, some interventions made participants significantly less empathic than control. This negative effect might explain some of the previous results on motivated empathy interventions. It might also be an important experimental tool for future studies: even if we cannot make people more empathic, restricting their empathy still gives us an opportunity to study empathy‚Äôs impact in social situations. An additional finding suggests that different types of motivated empathy interventions, with different underlying mechanisms for motivating empathy, perform equally in different contexts. First-time being tested, this result is surprising, as it should allegedly be easier to motivate oneself to empathize with ingroup members as compared with outgroup members.\n¬†\nTitle: Do Emotions Matter in Business Relationships?\nTime: 10:00-10:15\nAuthors: Zlatanou, Filoumena; Dickert, Dr Stephan; Henneberg, Prof.¬†Stephan C.\nAbstract: Emotions comprise a complex network of interconnected subevents that focus on a target (e.g., person, event, or object), and involve appraisal, attributional, behavioral, and physiological processes (Russell & Feldman Barrett, 1999). They exert a notable influence on many psychological procedures, including cognitive functions, social perceptions, motivations, judgement formation, decision-making and action tendencies (Han et al., 2007; Slovic et al., 2007). Next to their interpersonal influence, emotions may play a critical role in facilitating or hindering the development of business relationships, which are defined as long-term interorganizational collaborations and exchanges (Lambe et al., 2000; Palmatier, 2008) that hinge on social interactions between individuals acting as economic agents on behalf of their firms (Forkmann et al., 2022). This study investigates the role of emotions in business relationships, by specifically exploring their interplay with established attitudinal mechanisms such as trust and commitment, which characterize Business-to-Business (B2B) interactions (Harmeling et al., 2015). Fifteen senior managers from diverse B2B industries were subjected to in-depth interviews using the methodology established by Gioia et al.¬†(2013). The analysis gives rise to an elaborate nomological model highlighting the subtle impact of expected and unexpected (counterintuitive) emotions in the context of business relationships both at an interpersonal and interorganizational level. A gamut of positive and negative emotions is triggered by adherence to or deviation from relational norms, contributing to the development of pivotal attitudinal constructs (Selnes & Gr√∏nhaug, 2000). The present study links emotion and business literature to extend the present theoretical viewpoints on emotions as significant mechanisms underlying enduring business relationships."

This paper argues that the objective reality of a value apprehended by an emotion relates to its ‚Äòpractical specificity‚Äô. An emotion is high in practical specificity when it gives rise to a relatively narrow range of motivating goals. So-called ‚Äòbasic emotions‚Äô like fear or anger, particularly if interpreted as ‚Äòaffect programs‚Äô shaped by natural selection or early conditioning, are high in practical specificity. They are plausibly viewed as related to needs. Needs, unlike mere wants. are specifiable de re, independently of the description under which they are presented.(Wiggins 1998). They are therefore likely to motivate relatively specific goals. Other emotions, by contrast, notably aesthetic emotions, have ostensible formal objects that provide little or no guidance. If an emotion‚Äôs formal object does not in itself rationalize any goals or action tendencies, then it is unlikely to have originated in specific organismic need. A low degree of practical specificity may partly explain why aesthetic disputes are notoriously difficult to resolve. While aesthetic values may reflect vestiges of traits conditioned by evolutionary pressures, our current interest in them, honed by idiosyncratic biographical experience as well as by social facts, may be all that is now left of their ‚Äòreality‚Äô. That doesn‚Äôt mean such things don‚Äôt matter: just that their mattering is essentially subjective, and reflects no objective, stance-independent value.\n¬†\nTitle: Social Categories in the Dramatisation of Anger in Ancient Greek Comedy\nTime: 9:30-9:45\nAuthors: Irarrazabal, Manuela\nAbstract: This paper discusses anger in Aristophanes ‚Äôcomedies from the perspective of embodied cognitive theory. Following the ‚Äúconceptual metaphors‚Äù model proposed by Lakoff and Johnson (1980; 1999), according to which abstract concepts, such as anger, relay upon metaphors that are grounded in bodily experience, I argue that the representation of anger in Greek comedy sheds light on social aspects of Athenian life such as gender and class divisions. Lakoff‚Äôs ‚Äúopponent‚Äù metaphor (1987) designates a variety of symbolic representations used to conceptualise anger, such as it being an entity taking hold of us and imposing demands. This last idea can take the form of a transaction, which is in line with the view that emotions are strategic moves in an ongoing exchange between socially situated organisms (Griffiths and Scarantino, 2001). Conceptualisations of anger, and by this I mean presuppositions rather than explicitly articulated theories, are rich in ideologies as to when, where and towards whom emotions are justified. Members of a certain social group are portrayed as more prone to anger than others. Yet, the way these assumptions operate is not always that straightforward. While Aristotle‚Äôs claim that to be angry one needs to have a certain status in society (otherwise fear prevails), here I argue that by looking at comedy we can get a more nuanced understanding of the complexity of social categories in antiquity. As a corollary, this paper shows the value that literary representations of emotions can have for understanding both their history and their role in society.\n¬†\nTitle: Fluency, Prediction, and Motivation: Processing Ease, Expectations, and Goals Determine Emotional Reactions to Art\nTime: 9:45-10:00\nAuthors: Winkielman, Piotr; Jasko, Katarzyna; Yoo, Jenny\nAbstract: This theoretical talk, illustrated with data, discusses psychological mechanisms underlie aesthetic emotions. We propose important extensions of Processing Fluency Theory of Aesthetic Pleasure. This theory posits that ease of processing elicits positive feelings and thus enhances stimulus evaluations. In recent years, however, the theory faced serious empirical and conceptual challenges. We propose to extend it by integrating insights from Predictive Processing Frameworks (PPF) and the Epistemic Motivation Model (EMM). We propose four extensions. First, fluency of a stimulus depends on perceivers‚Äô expectations ‚Äì their internal model of the world. Second, perceivers also form expectations about fluency itself and thus can experience surprising fluency. These expectations can come from the individual‚Äôs history, their current task, and their environment. Third, perceivers can value fluency but also disfluency, reflecting their non-directional epistemic goals (motivation to achieve or avoid certainty). Fourth, perceivers also have directional epistemic goals, preferring specific conclusions or belief content. Consequently, affective reactions depend on whether the stimulus satisfies those goals. These directional epistemic goals may override concerns about fluency or change the value of fluency associated with specific content. We review supporting evidence and introduce novel predictions. By integrating insights from PPF and EMM, our expanded framework can better capture established fluency effects and highlights their limitations and extensions. This talk is based on a theoretical paper that has been recently published in the special issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. This special issue focused on integration of Predictive Coding Theories of Aesthetic Emotions with standard approaches to aesthetic judgments."

While prior studies have examined the influence of negative interpersonal experiences on unmet interpersonal needs, little is known about the role of positive interpersonal processes. Interpersonal capitalization, the action of sharing a positive personal event with close others, is an interpersonal process that increases positive affect and connectedness between the sharer and the responder. This study examined whether daily capitalization was associated with fluctuations in perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and positive affect among adolescents at higher- and lower-risk of suicidal ideation. Methods: This study included adolescents (Mage=15.55; range=12-18; 74.55% female) with a major depressive disorder considered at higher-risk for suicidal ideation (Higher-Risk group; n=23), and adolescents without psychopathology considered at lower-risk for suicidal ideation (Lower-Risk group; n=32). Participants completed a ten-day daily-diary procedure with measures of daily interpersonal capitalization, positive affect, perceived burdensomeness, and loneliness as a proxy for thwarted belongingness. Within-person analyses examined the associations of daily capitalization with burdensomeness, loneliness, and positive affect across groups. Results: Only the higher-risk group reported lower perceived burdensomeness and loneliness on days where they engaged in more capitalization. While higher capitalization was associated with higher positive affect in both groups, the higher-risk group benefitted from larger increases in positive affect in response to capitalization. Conclusion: Engaging in daily interpersonal capitalization may be useful to reduce daily thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness and increase positive affect among adolescents at higher risk for suicidal ideation.\n¬†\nTitle: The Effects of Emotion on Harmful Health Behaviors: Opposing Effects of Incidental Versus Integral Sadness\nTime: 9:30-9:45\nAuthors: Chen, Sarah (Shih-Hua); Wang, Ke; Rees, Vaughan ; Lee, Irene; Tan, Andy; Lerner, Jennifer\nAbstract: Judgment and decision making research has long assumed that integral and incidental forms of an emotion exert similar influences on behavior. However, this assumption remains largely unexamined. To address this gap, the present research explored differences in the underlying mechanisms of integral versus incidental sadness on decisions regarding addictive substances. Previous studies have found that incidental sadness increases craving to smoke as well as the duration of nicotine inhalation (Dorison et al., 2020). However, whether these effects also occur under the influence of integral sadness remains unclear. Drawing on the Appraisal Tendency Framework (Lerner & Keltner, 2000, 2001), we hypothesized that the effects of sadness on decisions about substance use would depend on the degree to which evoked sadness relates conceptually to the substance itself. The more closely linked sadness is to smoking, the lower craving for cigarettes should be. Across two experiments with smokers (N = 1,344), we hypothesized and found that, compared to neutral-mood, integral sadness decreased (d = ‚Äì.47, p &lt; .001), whereas incidental sadness increased (d = .12, p = .01), craving. Additionally, integral sadness increased intentions to quit, compared to neutral conditions (d = ‚Äì.45 ~ ‚Äì.51, p &lt; .001); incidental sadness did not. Our findings thus challenge the long-held assumption that incidental and integral forms of a given emotion share similar influences on judgment and decision. The present work offers theoretical advances for research on emotion and provides a novel perspective for incorporating insights from emotion science to predict and influence health behaviors.\n¬†\nTitle: Show No Fear: An Analysis of Staff Communication During Conflict Management in Acute Adult Inpatient Mental Health Settings.\nTime: 9:45-10:00\nAuthors: O‚ÄôNeill, Ciara; Brew, Benjamin; Hoe, Juanita; Cibelli, Francesca; McCabe, Rose; Lavelle, Mary\nAbstract: Inpatient mental health wards are under pressure due to high bed occupancy rates and staff shortages. Service users can be acutely unwell and often admitted involuntarily (40%). Behavioural displays of conflict such as aggression and violence can be features of this environment. Healthcare staff attempt to diffuse conflict behaviours, when they arise, through verbal and non-verbal communication, known as de-escalation. However, de-escalation training is not evidence based and practice varies greatly. Training programs advocate that de-escalating staff control their own emotional expression in such situations, particularly the expression of fear and anxiety. However, little is known about how this occurs in practice or how this relates to de-escalation success. The aim of this study is to explore the emotional expression of staff during de-escalation incidents in real world settings and examine the relationship with de-escalation success. De-escalation success has been operationalised as halting the sequence of conflict for that service user avoiding the need to use restrictive practices such as restraint (held to limit movement), seclusion (locked in isolation) and rapid tranquilisation (involuntarily injected with psychotropic medication). Method De-escalation incidents (n=46), involving a service user and one (or multiple) members of staff, on acute adult mental health wards are being recorded using body cameras worn by staff. Staff will also complete a questionnaire battery examining their experience and fear of violence at work. Analysis Staff verbal and nonverbal communication will be annotated in ELAN, providing a behavioural time series that can be exported for analysis. An adapted version of the Ethological Coding System for Interviews will guide hand annotation of behavioural markers associated with flight, displacement and social avoidance. The relationship between staff behaviours and (i) their fear of violence and (ii) de-escalation success will be examined. Results Analysis of this data is currently underway and the findings will be presented. The findings of this study will provide evidence to inform de-escalation training and clinical practice.\n¬†\nTitle: Coping with Emotional Distress via Self-Disclosure to Robots: Intervention with Caregivers\nTime: 10:00-10:15\nAuthors: Laban, Guy; Morrison, Val; Kappas, Arvid; Cross, Emily\nAbstract: People engage in self-disclosure to others when trying to regulate the impact of emotional distress. Here we introduce a novel long-term intervention aimed at supporting informal caregivers to cope with emotional distress via self-disclosing to a social robot. Informal caregivers often struggle in managing the emotional and practical demands of the caregiving situation and experience a lack of social support and interaction. Accordingly, we were interested in the extent of informal caregivers‚Äô self-disclosure towards a social robot over time, and how perceptions of the robot develop over time. Moreover, we wished to examine how this intervention made informal caregivers feel, and the extent to which interacting with the robot affected these individuals‚Äô emotion regulation. In a mediated experiment 34 Informal caregivers conversed with a social robot 10 times across 5 weeks about general everyday topics. Our results show that informal caregivers self-disclosed increasingly more to the robot across time and perceived it as increasingly social and competent over time. Participants‚Äô moods positively changed after interacting with the robot, which they perceived as more comforting over time. Participants also reported feeling increasingly less lonely and stressed. Finally, our results showed that after self-disclosing to the robot for 5 weeks, informal caregivers reported being more accepting of their caregiving situation, reappraising it more positively, and experiencing fewer feelings of blame towards others. These results set the stage for establishing relationships with robots, and highlight how communicating with social robots holds the potential for providing emotional support for people coping with emotional distress.\n¬†\nTitle: Parents‚Äô Depressive Symptomatology and their Perception of their Autistic Children‚Äôs Emotion Regulation Difficulties\nTime: 10:15-10:30\nAuthors: Costa, Andreia P.\nAbstract: Parents of autistic children have significantly more depressive symptomatology than parents of neurotypical children (Cohrs & Leslie, 2017). To understand which factors might contribute to that, 108 parents (36 ASD, 72 TD) of children aged 4-12 years answered to three questionnaires: the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977; parents‚Äô depressive symptomatology), the Autism Spectrum Quotient Questionnaire for Children (AQ-Child; Auyeung et al.¬†2008; children‚Äôs autistic traits), and the Emotion Regulation Checklist for children (ERC; Shields & Cicchetti, 1997; children‚Äôs emotion regulation ability). The results revealed that autistic children were reported by their parents as having less emotion regulation ability than neurotypical children (t(106)=7.68, p&lt;.001, ES r=.60). The odds of presenting clinically significant depressive symptomatology (CES-d&gt;16) among parents of children with autism were 5 times higher than among parents of neurotypical children (œá2(1)=13.29, p&lt;.01, OR=5). Furthermore, parents with high depressive symptomatology (CES-d&gt;16) reported increased emotion regulation difficulties in their children (t(106)=3.18, p&lt;.01, ES r=.30). Regression analyses revealed that parents‚Äô perceptions of their children‚Äôs emotion regulation difficulties were a better predictor of parents‚Äô depressive symptomatology than children‚Äôs diagnostic status. These results suggest that how parents perceive their children‚Äôs difficulties with emotion regulation might be an important aspect in the understanding of depression in parents of autistic children. However, further research is needed to better understand that relation as a cyclical and perhaps bi-directional relationship: parents‚Äô perception of their child‚Äôs emotional difficulties may be linked to their depressive symptomatology, which in turn may aggravate the children‚Äôs emotional difficulties."

Some evidence suggests that feedback generated by facial muscles can guide our interpretation of facial expressions, and that accurate recognition of others‚Äô emotional expressions is aided by a simulation mechanism involving our own motor system. I will present a preregistered study (N=30) that examines the effect of posing a smile on the automatic discrimination of facial expressions as indexed by steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) during an oddball paradigm. By presenting images of different facial expressions at different frequencies, one can derive power from EEG spectra at the same frequencies, and deduce the extent to which different types of expressions are automatically discriminated. Such ‚Äòfrequency tagging‚Äô techniques offer an excellent signal to noise ratio, and may reveal novel effects of facial feedback on the visual processing of facial expressions.\n¬†\nTitle: Judgments of Smile Genuineness in an Intergroup Context\nTime: 9:30-9:45\nAuthors: Milo≈°iƒç, Ana; Khan-Djuric, Anika; Kremer, Sophia; Rychlowska, Magdalena; Shore, Danielle M\nAbstract: We investigate how group membership affects smile judgments. In three preregistered studies (N = 400), participants rated the genuineness of posed and spontaneous smiles (UvA Nemo Smile Database). Participants initially evaluated smiles without having any information about the expresser‚Äôs group membership. Later, in a minimal group paradigm, they were informed about expressers‚Äô ingroup or outgroup status. We examine the influence of this information on participants‚Äô judgments. In Study 1, smile discrimination accuracy (measured with the d‚Äô statistic) was not affected by information about group membership. However, participants‚Äô tendency to rate smiles as genuine (measured with the criterion C) increased when the expresser was an ingroup member. The opposite tendency to rate smiles as posed was observed when the expresser was an outgroup member. Participants were also more motivated to accurately judge the smiles of ingroup than outgroup members. This result suggests that the interpretation of positive expressions, which are critical for establishing harmonious intergroup exchanges, can be distorted even in a minimal group paradigm. Studies 2 and 3 aim to replicate these findings. Additionally, Study 3 measured participants‚Äô looking behavior with an eye tracker. Ongoing analyses examine how group membership affects the d‚Äô and C statistics as well as the time participants spent looking at the expressers‚Äô eyes versus the mouth. We predict that this time will be longer for ingroup members compared to outgroup members. Together, the studies will provide insights into the role of attention to the eyes in judgments of facial expressions in intergroup contexts.\n¬†\nTitle: Personality Information Shapes Judgment of Emotional Expressions\nTime: 9:45-10:00\nAuthors: Sevi, Leora; Catmur, Caroline; Bird, Geoff\nAbstract: We do not infer the emotions of others in a vacuum of information about their traits; we often possess pre-existing knowledge of, or rapidly infer, the personality traits of those we interact with. However, emotion recognition research has mostly used anonymous target stimuli and thus has not considered how this potentially important source of information might be integrated into emotion judgments. We theorised that presenting personality information about targets (arbitrarily attributed and counterbalanced across participants) would alter the judgment of emotions from their facial expressions compared to judgments made prior to any trait information. This hypothesis was consistently supported across four studies (total N = 345), using both artificially-generated and real expression stimuli, and employing two paradigms, one requiring explicit ratings of emotion and the other implicit matching of expression stimuli. Study 3 supported the hypothesis that this effect depends on participants‚Äô idiosyncratic beliefs about the direction and magnitude of the relationships between traits and emotions. Study 4 replicated this result using naturalistic dynamic expression stimuli, and demonstrated that the effect of participants‚Äô personal trait priors further depends on their beliefs about its precision and the precision of the expression stimuli and trait priors (i.e., how diagnostic the trait or expression is as to the emotion); participant‚Äôs personal trait priors had the greatest effect on their shift in emotion judgment when they were more precise and combined with expressions judged to be less diagnostic, aligning with Bayesian theories of cue integration. Our findings highlight an important role for trait information in shaping judgments of emotion, with broader implications regarding the relationship between the processes of impression formation and emotion inference.\n¬†\nTitle: Embodied Emotion: Implicit Facial Muscle Response Patterns to Emotion Words Align with Prototypical Facial Emotional Expressions\nTime: 10:00-10:15\nAuthors: Wingenbach, Tanja S H; Baker-Kukona, Anuenue; Rismawati , Rizky\nAbstract: Embodiment grounds emotion in the body. Processing an emotion word is predicted to demonstrate itself in the body similarly to experiencing an emotion. Previous research showed facial muscle activity in line with an emotion word‚Äôs valence during processing. Much less is known about emotion-specificity in facial muscle activity while processing emotion words. The current study aimed to test for embodiment of emotion as represented in facial muscle activity across the face using emotion word stimuli. It was hypothesised that the implicit facial muscle activity aligns with the prototypical pattern for facial expressions of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise, and happiness. Participants (N = 76, male = 16, female = 59, non-binary = 1, M(age) = 26.9, SD = 8.4) silently read emotion words associated with the six emotion categories while facial electromyography was measured from the facial muscle sites: depressor anguli oris, zygomaticus major, levator labii, corrugator supercilii, and frontalis. Repeated measures contrasts for pattern hypotheses were conducted on a subset of participants (n = 50), as the remaining data is currently still being pre-processed. Contrasts were a-priori defined per emotion category across facial muscle sites based on prototypical assumptions of facial emotional expressions. Results showed significant alignment between the expected and the observed facial muscle activity for all six emotion categories. Given that the measured facial muscle activity aligned with the prototypical facial expression for the tested emotion categories, the current study further supports embodiment and suggests that emotion words are represented in the face in an emotion-specific manner.\n¬†\nTitle: Modulating Facial Emotion Recognition with Electrical Muscle Stimulation\nTime: 10:15-10:30\nAuthors: Korb, Sebastian; Efthimiou, Themis; Baker, Joshua; Mehu, Marc; Elsenaar, Arthur; Clarke, Alasdair\nAbstract: Facial neuromuscular electrical stimulation (fNMES) is a novel non-invasive method for precisely controlling activations of specific facial muscles for brief durations and at specific time points during a task. This provides a powerful means to better understand how facial expressions influence felt and perceived emotions. I will be presenting data from several experiments showing that 500 ms of fNMES to bilateral smiling muscles can bias responses in an emotion categorisation task, making participants more likely to perceive emotionally ambiguous facial expressions as happy."

Children begin this process from a young age, but it is unclear precisely how they do so. In particular, little is known about what specific emotional input infants and young children receive and learn from across the first few years of life. To address this, the present study used existing videos (SEEDLings; Bergelson & Aslin, 2017) wherein infants wore head-mounted video cameras during naturalistic 60-minute home sessions. Videos from 6 to 8 months (N=44) and 9 to 11 months (N=34) were coded for when a face was within infants‚Äô field of view and for facial muscle movements (using FACS; Ekman, Friesen, & Hager, 2002). We examined how often these facial configurations aligned with stereotypes corresponding to 18 different emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, interest, etc.). At both ages, the most frequently observed facial configurations (6-8 months: visible for an average of 41.2 seconds; 9-11 months: 45.1 seconds) did not match any of the emotion stereotypes. The next most frequently visible facial configuration was the happy stereotype (6-8 months: 25.1 seconds; 9-11 months: 20.8 seconds). Each of the 17 other emotion stereotypes was visible for fewer than 5 seconds on average among both age groups. These results suggest that infants are more often exposed to variable rather than stereotypical emotional input. Accordingly, this work suggests that the facial configurations often used in studies of emotional development may not be not reflective of what infants typically see in real world social interactions.\n¬†\nTitle: Negative Emotion Has a Disruptive Role in the Formation of Relational Memory in Different Age Groups\nTime: 16:53-17:01\nAuthors: √ñnay, Neslihan (UNIGE); Ulrike Rimmele\nAbstract: Episodic memory is a multi-component construct including place, people, and objects; these separate elements are integrated to form coherent memories of episodes of our lives. Age and emotion critically affect the integrating of different elements into a memory representation. Regarding age effects, a recent study showed associative memory to improve across development. On the other hand, emotion has been shown to reduce the memory for associations between the elements, decreasing the coherence with which a multi-element event is remembered. However, our knowledge about how emotion impacts associative memory and, thus, the coherence of memories in children compared to adults is very limited. In this study, we examine the effect of emotion on associative memory in children and adults. Children and adults learned events consisting of three elements (a face, a scene, an object). Half of the events contained a negative face expressing sadness. Memory was tested across all associations that had been presented in one event. We found that the presence of the negative face reduced memory for the associations between the event elements in all age groups. Our results replicate previous findings that show that associative memory for neutral stimuli develops with age and that emotion breaks memory coherence in adults. We extended the current knowledge by shedding light on the developmental aspect of emotional memory formation. These results bring a lot of new questions in the search for understanding the affective and developmental component of human memory and entail important information for clinical and educational settings.\n¬†\nTitle: Exploring Content of Children‚Äôs Discussions Related to a Shared Book Reading Intervention for Emotion Comprehension\nTime: 17:01-17:09\nAuthors: Bernard, Isabelle; Roy-Charland, Annie; Richard, Jacques F.; Mazerolle, Marie-Pier; Caissie, Julie; Perron, M√©lanie\nAbstract: One of the most important determinants associated with children‚Äôs mental well-being and school adaptation is emotion comprehension. According to Pons and Harris‚Äôs (2004) model, children develop nine emotional components from the ages of 3 to 12. In recent years, studies have shown that joint reading and dyadic reading of specialized books help stimulate emotional understanding (LaForge, 2017; Roy-Charland et al., 2021). Research has also suggested that adding an interactive component to reading leads to additional gains compared to reading alone (Grazzani & Ornaghi, 2011; Grazzani et al., 2015; Ornaghi et al., 2014). With a qualitative approach, we examined discussions among four focus groups following a shared reading of two stories from an emotion-based book created by Roy et al.¬†(2021). Our objective was to explore specific errors in emotional comprehension made by the children. Results show that children mostly have an understanding of the emotional component of desires but an incomplete understanding of the component of hiding, often interpreting these as mixed emotions. In comparison to third graders, some sixth graders could rectify these errors following the discussions. Additionally, we conducted a thematic analysis, revealing several key themes related to children‚Äôs emotional comprehension (e.g., disappointment, optimism, empathy, and frustration). These findings underscore the value of discussions in looking into and addressing specific errors in emotion comprehension. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of considering age-related differences in emotional development and the importance of integrating adapted interactive elements into interventions aimed at enhancing emotional comprehension and social skills in children.\n¬†\nTitle: Children‚Äôs Perception of Appraisal Dimensions in Emotional Contexts\nTime: 17:09-17:17\nAuthors: √ñzden, Zeynep B; Walle, Eric A\nAbstract: Appraisals are central to many views of the emotion process (e.g., Lazarus, 1991). However, few studies manipulate appraisal dimensions as independent variables to test the development of emotion understanding. The current study investigated 5- (N= 13) 7- (N= 21), and 9-year-old (N=10) children‚Äôs understanding of agency and goal-congruency appraisal dimensions (data collection is in progress). Stories featured a goal-congruent or goal-incongruent outcome caused by either the self, another character, or fate to elicit 6 distinct emotions (joy, gratitude, relief, sadness, anger, and shame; see Roseman, 2001). Participants viewed a target story, which was followed by two stories: one with similarly manipulated appraisal dimensions and the other with appraisal dimensions not matching the target story. Participants matched the story that would elicit the same emotion with the target story. A validation study with adults (N = 178) confirmed the validity of the appraisal manipulations for categorizing the target emotions and revealed that adults were significantly more successful in correctly categorizing the illustrated stories than the stories as written vignettes (p = .04). Preliminary GLMM analysis of the child data revealed a developmental trend for matching accuracy improving with child age: 5-year-olds = 42%, 7-year-olds = 54%, and 9-year-olds = 62%. Additional comparisons across discrete emotions revealed further nuance to these developmental differences. Our initial findings suggest a developmental progression in children‚Äôs appreciation of appraisal dimensions in classifying discrete emotional experiences.\n¬†\nTitle: Neurophysiological Correlates of Emotional Words Processing in Primary School Children Impacted by Covid 19 Emergency\nTime: 17:17-17:25\nAuthors: Toro, Veronica Debora; Serio, Gianluigi; Marinelli, Chiara Valeria; Trotta, Eugenio; Decarolis, Diletta; Palladino, Paola; Quarto, Tiziana\nAbstract: Previous literature suggests that emotions may substantially influence words processing, at both behavioral and neurophysiological levels. With regard to the latter, the N400 component, which is associated with the processes of lexical access and semantic and contextual integration that occur during reading, may be modulated by emotional valence. However, only few studies investigated neurophysiological correlates of this phenomenon in children and none of these studies focused on primary school children, thus investigating the early stages of reading‚Äôs ability acquisition and consolidation. Moreover, the literature lacks knowledge on the potential effect that an adverse event (such as covid-19 pandemic) may have on the neural processing of emotional words. Our study aims to investigate the effect of emotions on word processing and its related neurophysiological activity in primary school children and the potential impact of stress-related COVID-19 indexes. To achieve this, we used electroencephalography (EEG) with an event-related potential (ERP) approach, focusing on the N400 component. In our sample, in addition to neurophysiological and behavioral data during a word-processing task, information about stress conditions related to COVID-19 pandemic, individual emotional characteristics, and reading comprehension performances were acquired by self-administered questionnaires and standardized tests. Preliminary results show that in primary school children N400 component discriminates between words with different valence and arousal. Moreover, this modulation correlates with the degree of stress-COVID-19-related, individual emotional characteristics and reading comprehension performances. These findings underscore the effect that emotions, also in terms of experiencing a stressful event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic experience, as on word processing, especially if it occurs during a critical period for reading‚Äôs ability acquisition and consolidation.\n¬†\nTitle: Pacifiers at Play: Understanding Facial Emotional Exchange in Mother-Infant Dyads\nTime: 17:25-17:33\nAuthors: ≈†paremblek, Kristina; Polyzopoulou, Zoi; Hohulin, Elisabella; McGoldrick, Jodie; Cross, Jenny; Rychlowska, Magdalena; Vanderwert, Ross\nAbstract: Facial mimicry, or the brief automatic mirroring of another person‚Äôs facial actions, is involved in the processing of facial expressions. Existing evidence suggests that altering mimicry with the use of pacifiers in infants not only influences their facial responses but also impacts caregivers‚Äô responsiveness to their emotions and children‚Äôs long-term emotional development. Here we present novel evidence on pacifier use and its implications. A large questionnaire study examining pacifier use among 428 mothers of infants (0-36 months) showed that the use of pacifiers is associated with reduced parenting stress, better parent-child dynamics, and more positive perceptions of child‚Äôs affectivity. A second, experimental study, examined parental self-reports as well as video-recorded interactions of 62 mother-infant dyads (mothers aged 24-44 years; infants aged 8-11 months). Dyads engaged in two structured play tasks, where mothers demonstrated to infants stacking wooden rings or fitting objects into a cube. The tasks were performed in a randomized order with and without the pacifier in the infant‚Äôs mouth. We systematically coded and quantified facial expressions of the dyads during both tasks. Further analyses will examine expressive behavior of the dyads as a function of pacifier use and other characteristics, including infants‚Äô temperament as well as mothers‚Äô anxiety and depression. Together, the studies provide new insights into how pacifier use influences mother-infant interactions and provide methodological tools for human and automatic coding of such interactions."

Much empirical literature has been dedicated to the affective experience of music listeners, but considerably less attention has been given to the role of composers and their intentions in the process of conveying emotion in music. The present research takes a mixed-methods approach to filling this gap by combining qualitative in-depth interviews with quantitative psychometric surveys that together probe composers‚Äô engagement with emotion during their creative work. These studies investigated both composers‚Äô practical considerations when deploying various musical elements and composers‚Äô manipulation of those elements at a technical level to achieve the desired effects. The results show that whilst contemporary composers predominantly conceive of their work in terms consistent with a primarily Western classical idiom, they differ considerably in their use of distinct musical elements to evoke emotional responses in listeners as well as in the ways they approach listening to music qua composer versus qua listener and the practical ways in which they differentiate emotional reactions and cognitive perceptions. Composers‚Äô felt and intended emotions were correlated in the creative process, but higher states (e.g., inspiration) and psychophysiological responses (e.g., the chills) were more closely associated with felt positive emotion whilst effort was more closely associated with negative intended emotion. By synthesizing these results with the musicological literature, this research attempts to provide a first empirical foray into better understanding the transmission of emotion and culture through music.\n¬†\nTitle: Measuring Aesthetic Emotions with the ShortAesthet\nTime: 16:53-17:01\nAuthors: Beermann, Ursula; Hosoya, Georg; Scherer, Klaus\nAbstract: Aesthetic emotions are elicited by cultural activities like music, art, or other cultural activities. Cultural activities have positive effects on well-being, which may be mediated by the elicited emotions. Furthermore, personality dispositions affect the tendency to feel certain emotions. The Aesthetic Emotions Scale (AESTHEMOS, Schindler et al., 2017; Hosoya et al., 2017; Beermann et al., 2021) assesses aesthetic emotions across multiple aesthetic domains. However, for field research a shorter scale is necessary. To develop the Aesthetic Emotion Short Scale (ShortAesthet), 17 fuzzy sets were drawn from the AESTHEMOS item pool. In two online studies, participants answered questionnaires measuring personality, followed by 9 music excerpts (Study 1) or 9 paintings (Study 2). Each stimulus was followed by the ShortAesthet. The data were analyzed with an item response theory model for continuous responses (a simplified model of the one by Hosoya, 2019). Results demonstrated that the scale was able to depict the potential of the stimuli to evoke differential emotions. Canonical correlations indicated that participants‚Äô dispositions (e.g., openness) predicted the tendency to respond with certain emotions (e.g., interest in the stimuli). More studies are currently undertaken to further shorten the scale and enhance the applicability in field research. This will help to further study beneficial effects of aesthetic emotions.\n¬†\nTitle: The Effect of Creativity on Cognitive Reappraisal Effectiveness in a Sample of Older Adults\nTime: 17:01-17:09\nAuthors: Telazzi, Ilaria; Balzarotti, Stefania; Crespi, Matilde; Colombo, Barbara\nAbstract: Emotion regulation (ER) has been acknowledged as an important factor for older adults‚Äô well-being. Recently, it has been suggested that creativity may play a role in the effectiveness of cognitive reappraisal, an adaptive form of ER. The present study aims to test whether creativity is linked to greater effectiveness in the use of cognitive reappraisal in a sample of older adults. 43 healthy older adults (age range 62-100) living in a nursing home were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (who completed a primer creativity task) or the control group (who completed a filler task). After this first step, all participants performed an ER task, involving the observation of thirty images (neutral or negative). Each image was preceded by an instruction to either watch or use positive reappraisal. After watching each image, the participants were asked to rate their affective experience (valence and arousal plus a list of emotional labels). Results showed that the experimental group reported less unpleasantness and less intense negative emotions when using positive reappraisal compared to the control group while observing negative images. However, no significant differences between groups were found concerning self-reported arousal. Overall, these findings support a significant effect of creativity on the use of cognitive reappraisal in older adults: Creativity seems to improve the effectiveness of this ER strategy in decreasing unpleasantness of negative stimuli. Providing new evidence about the links between creativity and ER, the results of this study hold significant implications to foster healthy aging.\n¬†\nTitle: Beyond Beauty: Does Visual Art Facilitate Social Cognitive Skills?\nTime: 17:09-17:17\nAuthors: Ozbay, Yagmur; Oosterwijk, Suzanne; Stamkou, Eftychia\nAbstract: Engaging with art can move individuals through a myriad of emotions, provoke reflective thoughts, and lead to new ideas. Could art also influence interpersonal outcomes pertaining to the ways we interact with others and navigate the social world, that is, our suite of social cognitive skills? Here, we focus on visual art to explore the effect of art engagement on personal aesthetic experience and social cognitive skills. Across two studies, using veridical paintings and matched non-art photos, we examined the effect of art engagement on emotional (e.g., awe, being moved) and eudaimonic experiences (e.g., reflective thoughts), as well as social cognitive skills pertaining to Theory of Mind (ToM) and recognition of other‚Äôs emotions. Our findings showed that art engagement altered personal aesthetic experience through changes in emotional and eudaimonic outcomes. However, we did not find any support for the effect of art engagement on social cognitive skills.\n¬†\nTitle: Communicating Emotions Through Drawing: Cross-Cultural Similarities and Differences\nTime: 17:17-17:25\nAuthors: Fang, Xia; Sauter, Disa\nAbstract: Understanding the impact of culture on emotion communication is crucial for studying human emotion processing. This research explores how culture shapes the expression and perception of emotions through drawings. Specifically, participants from China, a historically homogeneous culture, and Canada, a historically heterogeneous culture, were asked to express (Experiment 1) and recognize (Experiment 2) seven basic emotions, including a neutral expression, in drawings. The results revealed that the intended emotions in drawings by Canadian individuals were better recognized compared to those by Chinese individuals, supporting the Historical Heterogeneity Theory that suggests historically heterogeneous cultures express more distinct emotions. However, it is noteworthy that this difference was more pronounced among Canadian perceivers than their Chinese counterparts. To further explore the potential influence of the Emotion Dialect Theory, Experiment 3 included participants from India to identify emotions in Canadian and Chinese drawings. Indian participants also exhibited a greater ability to recognize the intended emotions in drawings by Canadian compared to Chinese individuals. However, this difference was more pronounced than that observed among Chinese perceivers and less significant than that among Canadian perceivers. These findings suggest that both historical heterogeneity and emotion dialects may play significant roles in the communication of emotions through drawings."

Facial mimicry refers to the unconscious imitation of facial expressions, often observed when individuals mimic the facial expressions of those around them. Contagious yawning, on the other hand, is the tendency for individuals to yawn in response to seeing or hearing others yawn. In this study, we will explore the link between facial mimicry and contagious yawning. We hypothesize that individuals exhibiting more facial mimicry will also be more susceptible to yawn contagion. 41 healthy participants performed several passive-viewing computer tasks while we measured facial EMG (Zygomaticus Major, Corrugator Supercilii), ECG, and EDA. In the computer tasks, participants had to passively observe videos of faces smiling or yawning. Moreover, participants filled out questionnaires assessing empathy, theory of mind, quality of sleep, and energy level. Contrary to our hypothesis, the analysis revealed no significant correlation between the proportion of facial mimicry and the proportion of contagious yawning shown by participants (p&gt;.155). Neither the questionnaires nor control variables affected the rate of contagious yawning. The lack of a link suggests that contagious yawning and facial mimicry may rely on different underlying mechanisms. We discuss the implication of these results by taking into account the limitation of the present study and suggest the incorporation of alternative forms of mimicry (e.g., pupil mimicry) in future investigations to shed light on the potential link between these two phenomena.\n¬†\nTitle: Frustration: A Language-Specific Concept?\nTime: 16:53-17:01\nAuthors: Soriano, Cristina; Ogarkova, Anna\nAbstract: The English word ‚Äúfrustration‚Äù and its counterparts in Spanish (‚Äúfrustraci√≥n‚Äù), French (‚Äúfrustration‚Äù) and German (‚ÄúFrustration‚Äù) are quoted as translation equivalents in dictionaries and used as translation-equivalents in practice. However, they do not mean the same. We present linguistic and psycholinguistic evidence from 4 studies using observational (linguistic corpus) and elicited (self-report) data demonstrating that the English term is actually unique in meaning. In English, ‚Äúfrustration‚Äù is a typical anger word, very close in meaning to ‚Äúanger‚Äù itself. By contrast, in the other languages the frustration terms are not close in meaning to the main anger words and can refer to other emotion families too. The reason is that in Spanish, French and German the meaning of ‚Äúfrustration‚Äù profiles goal-obstruction, and it is only in English that the term has further specialized to profile anger specifically. Possible reasons for this are proposed based on appraisal theory and cross-cultural psychology. The novelties and limitations of the findings are discussed, along with their implications for researchers in the affective sciences using the word ‚Äúfrustration‚Äù in their work.\n¬†\nTitle: What Happens when We Witness Other‚Äôs Excellence? Exploring the (Dis)Similarities of Moral Elevation and Admiration in Children\nTime: 17:01-17:09\nAuthors: Ali, Shazza; Abrams, Dominic; Allen, Melissa\nAbstract: Studies with adults have shown that the good deeds of others (i.e., moral excellence) are positively evaluated, elicit feelings of moral elevation and motivate prosocial action, whereas extraordinary talent (i.e., non-moral excellence) can elicit admiration and motivate self-improvement. However, it is unclear whether children respond to others‚Äô displays of (moral) excellence in the same way, and whether there are developmental differences. In Study 1 (N=213, 5-11 year-olds) and Study 2 (N=203, 9-11 year-olds), we explore children‚Äôs self-reported cognitive, affective, and motivational responses to videos of protagonists fundraising for outgroup members (moral excellence condition), excelling in sport (non-moral excellence condition) and attending a cooking class (control condition). In line with adults, 9-11-year-olds evaluated sporting ability as significantly more skilful than cooking and fundraising behaviours. They also evaluated the fundraising behaviour as significantly more benevolent and reported increased prosocial motivation compared to the other two conditions. In contrast, younger children (e.g., aged 5-7) showed no significant differences in how they evaluated the behaviour in the three conditions or in their subsequent motivations. There were no clear developmental trends for the affective experience associated with each condition (e.g., moral elevation and admiration), measured via self-reported emotions and physical sensations. Our findings suggest that by mid-late childhood, children may distinguish between different types of behaviour, which inspire different motivations, in a way that is similar to adults. Thus, exposure to, and acknowledgement of others‚Äô prosocial behaviour, may be key components in increasing prosocial motivation during this developmental period.\n¬†\nTitle: Exploring Loneliness as a Multidimensional Experience: Social, Emotional, and Existential Dimensions Across the Adult Lifespan\nTime: 17:09-17:17\nAuthors: McKenna-Plumley, Phoebe; Turner, Rhiannon; Yang, Keming; Groarke, Jenny\nAbstract: Experiences of loneliness are prevalent across the lifespan and confer harmful health and wellbeing outcomes. Accurately conceptualising loneliness is therefore important to allow effective research, assessment, and interventions to manage it. While loneliness is usually measured as a unidimensional emotion, it can also be conceptualised as multidimensional, including social, emotional, and existential dimensions. No previous research examines these three dimensions concurrently in a cross-lifespan sample and knowledge of their prevalence is lacking. This study tested the validity of this three-dimensional model and evaluated the levels of these dimensions in three age groups. Data were gathered from 714 adults in the UK and Ireland via an online survey using validated scales of social, emotional, and existential loneliness. One-way ANOVAs assessed age group differences in the levels of these loneliness dimensions across younger, middle, and older adulthood. Structural equation modelling tested the model fit of competing dimensional models of loneliness. Age group analysis revealed a linear decline in emotional and existential loneliness, with the highest levels in younger adulthood. Social loneliness showed a different pattern with significantly higher levels in midlife. The three-dimensional model including social, emotional, and existential loneliness was found to provide the best fit to the data. This research makes a significant contribution by validating a multidimensional model of loneliness and describing lifespan patterns of these dimensions in the same sample. The findings indicate that dimensions of loneliness are experienced to different degrees at different life stages. Implications for loneliness research will be discussed.\n¬†\nTitle: Is the Emotion Disgust Culturally Invariant?\nTime: 17:17-17:25\nAuthors: Kupfer, Tom R\nAbstract: Although emotion terms vary across cultures and languages, for decades emotion scholars have debated the extent to which this variation is superficial or reflects fundamental differences in emotion experience. We examined this question with regard to the emotion disgust in over 60 countries. While the emotion term ‚Äúdisgust‚Äù and its referents varies across cultures, we found the oral-gastric rejection response towards pathogen cues involving subjective experiences such as nausea, to be invariant across cultures. Moreover, the response towards ectoparasite cues, a closely related threat, differed in line with functional expectations. We discuss the extent to which our findings support the claim that disgust is a universal, functional emotion, despite superficial differences in emotion terms across cultures."

These facial expressions are widely assumed to serve fundamental social functions during day-to-day spontaneous social interactions. Empirical work has, however, focussed almost exclusively on how these expressions are understood, with only a small number of studies documenting the actual occurrence of these facial expressions within naturalistic settings. To quantify the evidence for spontaneous production of the six archetypal facial expressions during real-life social interaction, we conducted a thorough review of the literature on facial expression production between 1979 and 2023. We summarised 1) which of the six archetypal facial expressions was documented, 2) whether specific morphological features were recorded systematically (e.g.¬†using the Facial Action Coding System: Ekman et al., 2002) to confirm similarity to the archetypes, and 3) whether quantitative data of occurrence (rates, frequency) was given. Except for happiness (smiling), this search yielded a very poor database with few studies providing sufficient quantitative evidence. In sum, we argue that there is an insufficient body of research to justify the prevailing view that these six facial expressions occur commonly during everyday social communication. The study of facial behaviours, including their social function, therefore, needs a radical rethink.\n¬†\nTitle: Navigating Truth: Unraveling the Impact of Emotional Expressions on News Credibility in the Era of Misinformation\nTime: 16:53-17:01\nAuthors: Klewes, Geraldine; Mauersberger, Heidi; Kastendieck, Till; Hareli, Shlomo; Hess, Ursula\nAbstract: Emotions play a pivotal role in the manipulation of information, particularly in the realm of fake news where they serve as a strategic tool to captivate audiences. Taking into account the rise of fake news in recent years and the consequent shift in informational dynamics, our study explored how individuals perceive and react to news reports with content aligned or misaligned with displayed emotions. For this, 237 participants rated the credibility of news reports containing positive, negative, and neutral information about an (unknown) public figure. The news reports were presented either in a happy, sad, angry, or neutral tone of voice, accompanied by the corresponding facial expression. Participants also evaluated the appropriateness of the emotions shown during the news report and their perceived closeness to the news reporter. We found that the perceived truthfulness of a news report and the trustworthiness of the news reporter are influenced by both the emotions conveyed by the news reporter and the congruence between these emotions and the content of the report. First of all, adopting a neutral tone of voice alongside a neutral expression increased the perceived truthfulness across various types of news reports. Further, emotions congruent with the content, such as displaying happiness while reporting positive news, increased the perceived appropriateness of news reporters‚Äô behaviors and the interpersonal closeness to news reporters, subsequently elevating the perceived trustworthiness of the news reporter and the truthfulness of a news report. Our findings shed light on the nuanced relationship between emotional expressions and credibility in the context of news reporting‚Äîan issue of growing significance in the era of misinformation.\n¬†\nTitle: Mimicking the Emotional Expressions of Others : Are all Expressive Features Made Equal?\nTime: 17:01-17:09\nAuthors: Verschoor, Stephan; K√ºster, Dennis; Schultz, Tanja; Hommel, Bernhard\nAbstract: What determines whether and how much we mimic others? The Theory of Event Coding (TEC) proposes that the intensity of mimicry in dyadic interaction is a function of perceptual-feature overlap, with more overlap leading to more mimicry. TEC makes no provisions for the potential social signaling value of different types of facial expressions. In contrast, the Emotional Mimicry in Context (EMC) view suggests that the social signal value of the to-be mimicked target behavior, can modulate mimicry. We present four online Me-Other Overlap Tasks (MOOT, N = 256) featuring real-time interaction with avatars to manipulate behavioral similarity (synchronous, asynchronous). Additionally, we manipulated the attention of participants to their relationship with avatar. In the mimicry phase, the avatars produced three expressions: smile (affiliative), frown (counter-affiliative)and head-roll (neutral). In line with both TEC and EMC, we found significant mimicry for all three expressions. However, contrary to predictions derived from EMC, our current results revealed no significant differential mimicry effects between expressions. Thus, as predicted by TEC, mimicry was modulated only by perceptual-feature overlap , not by the social signaling value of facial expressions. We discuss possible interpretations of these results and how the MOOT could be further leveraged to produce contrasting tests of TEC and EMC accounts of facial mimicry.\n¬†\nTitle: Understanding the Process of Physiological Metonymy in Expressing Emotions\nTime: 17:09-17:17\nAuthors: Kim, Haejin; Lee, Donghoon\nAbstract: We often use such physiological metonymy as saying ‚ÄòI am trembling‚Äô to describe our emotions. However, the speaker‚Äôs intention may be ambiguous unless it is lexicalized to convey the referenced target (e.g., fear), as trembling can also be experienced in response to cold temperatures. In the current research, we aimed to compare the comprehension processing differences when the physiological metonymic expressions were used with non-literal meaning (emotion) versus literal meaning (physical). We conducted the experiment by dividing participants into two groups: physical meaning (literal), and emotional meaning (non-literal). In a maze task, sentences were presented word by word. For instance, in the physical group: ‚ÄòWhile suffering from a cold, my face flushed ‚Ä¶‚Äô and in the emotional group: ‚ÄòWhen I experienced racial discrimination, my face flushed ‚Ä¶‚Äô Participants were then provided with a two-word choice, such as in the physical group: feverish (target word) vs.¬†shame (distractor) and in the emotional group: shame (target word) vs.¬†feverish (distractor). Linear mixed-effects analysis of RTs revealed a significant interaction between group (emotion, physical) and distractor (distractor, control) (b=-71.00, SE=10.91, t=-6.51, p &lt;.001). When the physiological metonymic expressions were used in their emotional sense, there was a significant interference effect, with response times being slower for distractor words compared to control words. However, there was no significant difference in the physical sense. Current results suggest that when expressing emotions non-literally, the non-literal senses emerge through the comprehension of literal meaning, whereas literal meaning can be directly understood.\n¬†\nTitle: A Systematic Evaluation Framework on Emotion Perception for Large Language Models Using Appraisal Theory\nTime: 17:17-17:25\nAuthors: Yongsatianchot, Nutchanon; Thejll-Madsen, Tobias; Marsella, Stacy C\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate competencies in many areas, including science, medicine, laws, story generation, and basic emotion perceptions. Crucially, we begin to see more LLM‚Äôs applications involving emotion content, such as role-playing characters or actors and LLMs as therapists. In such applications, LLM‚Äôs responses could have significant impacts on the user‚Äôs well-being and social life. Therefore, it is important to understand how existing LLMs perceive and respond to emotion content in comparison to humans. Researchers have begun to investigate LLMs on various emotion capabilities, but a structured evaluation framework guided by an emotion theory is still lacking. Without a theory, it is unclear what the evaluation tries to probe. Further, a theory provides a way to identify critical aspects of the space of possible stimuli. Toward that end, in this work, we propose a systematic evaluation based on the appraisal theory of emotion and coping. Our evaluation framework consists of two steps. The first step is emotional scenario generation, whereby we create a diverse set of scenarios by systematically manipulating key appraisal dimensions. We then ask human participants to rate emotions in these scenarios. The second step is the reverse appraisal test, in which we turn these scenarios into multiple tests by removing key appraisal dimensions, such as goals and beliefs, to be filled in by LLMs using the remaining dimensions and emotions. This evaluation offers a deeper understanding of the emotion perception capability of LLMs by examining how they predict emotion and their sensitivity toward key appraisal dimensions."

Feeling shaky at a job interview can undermine performance, whereas feeling excited during a sporting competition can optimize performance. Thus, affect regulation ‚Äì the way people influence their affective responses ‚Äì might also play a key role. To test this hypothesis, we adapted synergistic mindsets intervention (SMI; Yeager et al., 2022) to high-stakes situations. It was motivated by the idea that (1) mindsets both about situations and one‚Äôs response to situations can be shaped to maximize challenge vs.¬†threat responding, and (2) challenge vs.¬†threat affective responses are linked to enhanced performance. We focused on esports, a context that permits the measurement of affective responses and well-defined outcomes. We randomly assigned gamers (N = 300) to the SMI or a control condition (learning about the brain). After two weeks of daily gaming, players competed in a cash-prize tournament. Despite changes in beliefs about the usefulness of negative emotions (d = .48, 95% CI [.25, .71]), and stress responses (d = .39, 95% CI [.16, .62]) and increased usage of reappraisal (d = .47, 95% CI [.24, .70]), compared to the control condition, synergistic mindset gamers did not show greater challenge affective responses nor superior performance outcomes (ds &lt; .15). This questions the previous assumptions about the relationship between affective changes and performance outcomes and suggests that synergistic mindset intervention‚Äôs effectiveness might vary across contexts.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotional Witness Effect and Misinformation: Implications for Misidentification, Reliability, and Memory Accuracy in Forensic Contexts\nTime: 16:53-17:01\nAuthors: Zloteanu, Mircea\nAbstract: The emotional state of a witness can impact how they are perceived within a forensic setting. If the emotions a witness portrays seem incongruent with their statement, they are perceived as deceptive, untrustworthy, or inaccurate. This study considers the dynamics of this effect on subsequent (mis)identification, perceptions of reliability and honesty, and observer memory accuracy of the event, with a focus on susceptibility to misinformation. Here, the role of misinformation within the recall stage will be measured, offering a novel insight into cross-over effects with gender and emotional states. It is predicted that the emotional tone of a witness‚Äôs video statement (congruent versus incongruent) influences how observers perceive the statement and subsequently recall its details, as well as the influence of misinformation (low, medium, high). The interaction of emotional expression and the gender of the witness is also considered. The analysis will emphasise congruency and expectation effects concerning emotions and gender, exploring the potential beneficial aspect of emotions enhancing accurate witness recall and identification, contrasted with the detrimental effects where emotional cues may divert attention from factual statements and susceptibility to misinformation. By investigating these cross-over effects, the findings aim to contribute to our understanding of how emotions impact judgments in forensic settings.\n¬†\nTitle: Racial Differences in Emotion Socialization and Racial Socialization: The Need for an Integrated Lens\nTime: 17:01-17:09\nAuthors: Montague, Diana P. F.; Logan, Faith; Lozada, Fantasy T\nAbstract: We addressed the role of racial socialization goals in explaining differences in Black American and White American parents‚Äô responses to their children‚Äôs emotions. Black (n = 67) and White (n = 90) parents of young adolescents (9 to 14 years) completed measures of their racial and emotion socialization goals and responses to their adolescent‚Äôs negative emotions. We found that Black parents rated preparation for bias and protective emotion socialization goals as more important than did White parents and reported greater likelihood of non-supportive responses than White parents. Preparation for bias goals significantly predicted two of three non-supportive responses and mediated the relation between parent race and non-supportive responses. We argue for viewing emotion socialization and racial socialization through an integrated lens, which would support the advancement of research and clinical practice guidelines that are more culturally sensitive to Black families.\n¬†\nTitle: The Impact of Shame, Humiliation, and Criminal Justice Experiences on Revenge in Crime Victims\nTime: 17:09-17:17\nAuthors: McGaughey, Katie; McGlinchey, Emily; Hanna, Donncha; Armour, Cherie\nAbstract: Background: Criminal victimisation has been linked to an increased risk of violent offending, often motivated by revenge (Jackson et al., 2019). Experiencing revenge desire could also be harmful for crime victims‚Äô mental health (Barcaccia et al., 2020). To limit revenge‚Äôs harmful effects, researchers have examined the predictors of revenge. However, little is known about the predictors of revenge in crime victims specifically. Additionally, anger‚Äôs impact on revenge has been extensively researched. Yet the role of the negative self-conscious emotions, including shame and humiliation, is understudied. Objectives: To identify whether experiencing feelings of shame and humiliation increases revenge desire and behaviour in crime victims. The impact of criminal justice system experiences, mental health factors, and emotional regulation on revenge desire and behaviour in crime victims is also examined. Method: 150 participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire, measuring criminal justice satisfaction and its impact on coping, revenge desire, shame-proneness, depression, anxiety, and emotional regulation. Participants then completed an investing game, in which they were betrayed by their partner. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: shame and humiliation induction, pride induction, and a control group. After emotions were induced, participants were given the chance to take revenge against their partner via noise blasts. Results: Descriptive and inferential results (available in March 2024) will be discussed and interpreted. Conclusions: Identifying victims who are experiencing revenge desire, or at risk of taking revenge, is vital due to revenge‚Äôs potentially harmful effects. This knowledge could inform clinicians, victim support agencies, and violence prevention strategies.\n¬†\nTitle: Activist Interpreting in Abortion Clinics: Emotional Challenges and Self-Care Strategies\nTime: 17:17-17:25\nAuthors: Bartlomiejczyk, Magdalena; Poellabauer, Sonja; Straczek-Helios, Viktoria\nAbstract: Emotionality in interpreting has been addressed within ‚Äúthe psycho-affective turn in Interpreting Studies‚Äù (Korpal 2016). The fact that interpreters react emotionally to the content they interpret reflects human tendency to empathy (Merlini 2015), and this has repeatedly been confirmed by self-reports obtained from community interpreters working for refugees (Mahyub-Rayaa and Baya-Essayahi 2021; Gonz√°lez Campanella 2023), unaccompanied child migrants (Sultaniƒá 2021), or survivors of domestic violence (Toledano Buend√≠a and del Pozo Trivi√±o 2015). Based on a review of studies on emotionality and interpreting, including coping and self-care strategies among interpreters, we present a case study of a group of activist interpreters Ciocia Wienia, a Vienna-based informal pro-choice collective. The activists provide information and facilitate abortion travel from Poland to Austria. They offer on-site support to their clients, including interpreting in abortion clinics. We present original data from a corpus of 13 qualitative in-depth interviews with members and associates of Ciocia Wienia. Based on a qualitative content analysis, this contribution investigates which situations and stressors are described as emotionally challenging and which coping strategies and techniques of self-care and mental hygiene are employed to process burdensome emotions. Our results suggest that negative feelings such as sadness, frustration and anger, stress, uncertainty, and the strain of having to finetune empathetic communication make work in such a context emotionally taxing, even though positive emotions are reported as well. Apart from sharing with the group and supervision, only a few activists seem to have developed a set of distinct individual self-care and coping strategies.

One reason this debate has persisted for over a century is that links between physiological elements and subjective emotional experiences may be multi-dimensional, non-linear, and highly interactive, posing challenges for formal computational models. Thus, machine learning may usefully advance these debates. As part of the Emotion Physiology and Experience Collaboration, we organized a competition wherein 12 teams (50 researchers) with machine learning experience/background aimed to predict continuous self-ratings of core affect (valence and arousal) from multi-modal measures of peripheral nervous system activity (e.g., cardiography and respiration). By comparing instances where top-performing models made predictions on test data with (a) real physiology data vs.¬†(b) simulated random physiology, we uncovered evidence that models did indeed leverage physiology to make predictions about emotion reports. These results provide preliminary evidence that emotion does indeed manifest in physiology. Furthermore, even though relationships between emotional experiences and physiology may be too complex to interpret, these results provide preliminary evidence that such relationships can nonetheless be captured using machine learning methods. These preliminary results are based on a small dataset and will be further investigated on larger datasets."

In 12 studies (N = 1,694), we examined the impact of expressing empathic (happy-for-ness & sympathy) and counter-empathic emotions (schadenfreude & gl√ºckschmerz) on the evaluations of the expressers of these emotions. First, we explored in Studies 1.1 and 1.2 the perceived appropriateness of empathic and counter-empathic emotions following the fortunes or misfortunes of others. Next, we examined in Studies 2.1 and 2.2 the impact of expressing empathic and counter-empathic on the evaluations of expressers of these emotions in terms of warmth, competence, and morality. Last, we examined the perceived prosociality of (Studies 3.1-3.5) and willingness to interact (Studies 4.1-4.3) with expressers of empathic and counter-empathic emotions. Findings from the four series of studies consistently revealed that, compared to empathic emotions and expressers showing these emotions, counter-empathic emotions and expressers showing them were evaluated more negatively. Moreover, results of the first two series of studies showed that these differences in evaluation were more pronounced for major events than for minor events. In the first two series of studies, we also found that expressions of happy-for-ness led to more positive evaluation than sympathy. Whereas expressions of schadenfreude led to more negative evaluation than gl√ºckschmerz. These findings, however, were not found in the subsequent two series of studies.\n¬†\nTitle: Effects of Emotion Recall Instructions and Valence on Self- And Other-Perceived Emotion Intensity and Empathy\nTime: 16:38-16:46\nAuthors: Braun, Nadine; Schouten, Iris\nAbstract: Competing theories, e.g., emotions as basic categories, appraisals, or dimensions, may affect practical applications such as autobiographical recall for scientific research or psychotherapeutic purposes by leading to variations in emotion recall instructions (ERI). This could affect the recall, particularly recalled emotion intensity (EI) and others‚Äô perceptions of the recalled experience. Therefore, we investigate the effects of ERI (discrete emotion / appraisals) and valence (positive: happiness / negative: anger) on self-perceived (s-EI) and other-perceived (o-EI) emotion intensity in a preregistered two-part study. We first conducted a 2x2 between-participants online experiment (N=153). Trait cognitive reappraisal (TCR) was considered a potential moderator between valence and s-EI. Contrary to our expectation that appraisals foster more intense recall, we found no significant effect of ERI on s-EI. Expectedly, positive (M=5.99, SD=1.14) compared to negative recall (M=5.20, SD=1.10) led to higher s-EI, F(1,149)=18.41, p&lt;.001, Œ∑p2=.11. TCR did not moderate this relationship. There was no interaction effect. Part 2 explores the recall-text corpus produced in Part 1, comparing s-EI and o-EI. Although ERI did not affect s-EI, appraisal-based ERI might result in (partial) replications of the respective appraisal structures in the produced texts, possibly influencing others‚Äô perceptions of writers‚Äô experiences. In a within-participants experiment, we thus ask different participants to annotate the texts on the same measures as the writers. Moreover, we analyze writer-directed empathy, TCR, and trait empathy. Since data collection for Part 2 is still ongoing at the time of abstract submission, the complete results of the study will be presented at ISRE2024.\n¬†\nTitle: Mixed Methods Comparison of Relationships with Love vs Those with Ambivalence\nTime: 16:46-16:54\nAuthors: Aumer, Katherine V; Blake, Robert; Gray, Kristin; Ford, Ke ªala\nAbstract: This study explored the quantitative and qualitative differences between relationships with only love versus those with both love and hate (i.e., ambivalence). A sample of 654 participants from a local university answered questions regarding the quality of their relationships and the personalities of a person they only love and a person they both love and hate. We hypothesized that ambivalent targets would be seen as having less of the desirable big five personality traits and ambivalent relationships would be less intimate and satisfying than relationships with only love. Participants were asked to describe why they love both persons and themes were extracted. Controlling for the relationship category, participants rated the person they felt ambivalent about lower on all big five personality traits. Additionally, participants reported more intimate and frequent contact with participants they only love versus those they felt ambivalent about. Finally, thematic analysis revealed that participants described their love in ambivalent relationships with more negative emotion words and references to discovery. No differences were found regarding the degree of care for the target. Ambivalence is associated with lower quality in a relationship, however thematic analyses show that these relationships are still important. Interpersonal relationships research should consider the likelihood of complex emotions, especially ambivalence, across a variety of relationship categories. Our study suggests that many relationships may experience ambivalence and it may be an important part of relationship or personal development.\n¬†\nTitle: Unveiling the Dynamics of ‚ÄúSeeing Afresh‚Äù: Enacted Perspective-Taking Through Role-Play Dialogues with Climate Emotions\nTime: 16:54-17:02\nAuthors: Gao, Jie\nAbstract: Background and objectives: What should be taught to support young people‚Äôs emotional capability development in the Anthropocene and digital age? Against the backdrop of medicalizing climate emotions which can be understood as both appropriate response to structural injustice and valuable for moral functioning, our design-based research project echoes an increasing educational emphasis on pedagogical approaches that promote holistic development, and aims to create a space where reflective explorations of a plurality of values and perspectives are supported. To this end, and informed by Dewey‚Äôs pragmatism, Varela‚Äôs enactivism, and Freire‚Äôs critical pedagogy, we repurposed an educational game initially designed for teaching critical thinking with philosophy for children (P4C), to incorporate role-play and open-ended questions that reflect the needs and queries of today‚Äôs Youth living in the global north. The game experience encourages players to alternate between roles of active listeners and speakers, engaging in reflective dialogues, observation, and collective debriefings. Method: Fourteen young adults from an university volunteered to play the game, and participated in one-on-one post-game interviews for unveilling the experiential processes. Both the gameplay and the interview were filmed for observation and transcribed for analysis. Combining systematic coding strategy from both qualitative (reflexive thematic analysis) and (micro)phenomenological methods, we conducted analyses of the transcripts for emergent patterns and structures. Result: The analysis of observational data show that our participants are able to (1) adopt the perspectives of their characters, (2) interact with another player/character‚Äôs perspective, (3) leap beyond their immediate situations and proactively seek out specific perspectives beyond those encountered in the gameplay, and (4) engage in reflections on their character portrayals across the different stages of dialogic interactions. These processes capture the temporal extendedness of perspective-taking and possibilities of nurturing moral imagination through affectively scaffolded dialogic interactions. Furthermore, preliminary analysis of interview data revealed individual differences in their journeys and pathways towards sustainability, suggesting both potentials and limits of eliciting self-transcendent emotions for sustainability education.\n¬†\nTitle: Mapping Empathy‚Äôs Oeuvre: Toward a Typology of Empathy in Media Selection, Processing, and Reception\nTime: 17:02-17:10\nAuthors: Kalny, Callie S.; Sukalla, Freya; Walter, Nathan; Balint, Katalin"

Previous work suggested that the level to which one identifies emotional events in agreement with others is associated with a broader and more sophisticated emotion vocabulary. However, the impact of labeling behavior on the emotion perception process remains unknown. Here, we examined this using the Emotion Segmentation Paradigm, where people identify emotion events from documentary clips. We randomly assigned participants to the labeling (N=163, 89 men, 71 women, 3 nonbinary) or no-labeling condition (N=193, 85 men, 102 women, 6 nonbinary). In the no-labeling condition, participants were instructed to click whenever they observed emotions. In the labeling condition, participants were instructed to click only when they had a label for the emotion in mind, and then to provide the label. To quantify emotion perception, we located within each condition timepoints where the group collectively agreed that emotions occurred (i.e., consensus events). We then used Signal Detection Theory measurements to compute the sensitivity at discriminating emotion from non-emotion (sensitivity) and the threshold for identifying an event (criterion). We found that compared to the no-labeling group, the labeling group was less sensitive at discriminating consensus events from non-events (t(349)=5.23, p &lt; .001) and was more conservative at identifying events (t(341)=-4.15, p &lt; .001). Future research will focus on exploring factors driving these differences.\n¬†\nTitle: Accurate Perception of both Quality and Quantity of Blended Emotions Conveyed Through Dynamic Multimodal Expressions\nTime: 16:38-16:46\nAuthors: Israelsson , Alexandra Ai; Laukka, Petri\nAbstract: Although people frequently report that they experience more than one emotion at the same time, few studies have investigated how blended emotions are communicated nonverbally. In a previous study, we showed that participants could accurately judge which emotions were expressed in blended emotion-pairs, conveyed through dynamic multimodal (facial/bodily/vocal) expressions. The current study in addition asked if participants can accurately judge how prominently different emotions are expressed in blended emotion-pairs. Actors were instructed to express all pairwise blends of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness ‚Äì using facial gestures, body movement, and vocal sounds. Each blended emotion was portrayed with three different proportions: 30:70 (e.g., 30% happiness and 70% sadness), 50:50 (e.g., 50% happiness and 50% sadness) and 70:30 (e.g., 70% happiness and 30% sadness). Participants rated each recording on two scales (out of 5 available scales: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness). Results showed that all emotion blends were accurately perceived with significantly higher ratings on scales corresponding to intended vs.¬†non-intended emotions, for all emotion proportions (30:70, 50:50, 70:30). Participants were also able to correctly judge which was the dominant and the less dominant emotion in the 30:70 and 70:30 stimuli. These findings show that it is possible to recognize both the quality (i.e., which emotions are present) and the quantity (i.e., how much of each emotion is present) from blended emotion-pairs. This suggest that emotion perception is more nuanced and flexible than previously thought, which may help us to understand and adaptively respond to a complex environment.\n¬†\nTitle: Anticipation of Positive and Negative Counterfactual Emotions Shape Behaviour\nTime: 16:46-16:54\nAuthors: Feeney, Aidan; Lorimer, Sara; Hoerl, Christoph; McCormack, Teresa; Beck, Sarah; Johnston, Matthew\nAbstract: Anticipation of emotion can shape decisions about future behaviour. The paradigmatic example, anticipated regret, has been implicated in health-related decision-making but it is not known whether it is the valence of regret or its counterfactual nature which is important. Recent work on influenza vaccination suggests that anticipated relief, too, may influence decisions to engage in positive health behaviours. To explore these affective components further and address the generality of possible mechanisms underlying these associations, we examined whether anticipated relief and anticipated regret independently predict testicular self-examination (TSE) intention and behaviour. We distinguished between counterfactual relief (relief that a worse outcome did not obtain) and temporal relief (relief that an unpleasant experience is over). 567 cis-gendered males completed measures of anticipated regret, anticipated counterfactual and temporal relief, attitudes, norms, perceived behavioural control, intention, and measures of anxiety and shame. One month later the same participants were re contacted and asked about their engagement in testicular self-examination in the previous month. Anticipated counterfactual relief and anticipated regret are independent, positive, predictors of intention to engage in testicular self-examination and, indirectly, testicular self-examination behaviour itself. Although anticipated temporal relief was negatively associated with intention to engage in TSE, it was not associated with TSE behaviour when other predictors were controlled for. Our results suggest that it may be the counterfactual nature of anticipated regret and relief that underlie their association with TSE and other health-promoting intentions and behaviours. Both positively and negatively valenced counterfactual emotions may be useful in helping to promote healthful behaviour.\n¬†\nTitle: Practical Irrationality Mystified: A Reply to Agnes Moors\nTime: 16:46-16:54\nAuthors: Kƒ±lƒ±√ß, Ongun\nAbstract: Agnes Moors, in her book ‚ÄúDemystifying Emotions‚Äù provides a goal-directed account of practical irrationality in emotional episodes (Moors 2022). Moors claims that the goal-directed processes governing emotional episodes do not differ in kind from goal-directed processes governing mundane forms of goal-pursuit. It follows that emotion plays no distinctive explanatory role in making sense of the practical irrationality in emotional episodes. Moors‚Äô argument is two pronged: (i) some instances of practical irrationality are merely apparent, (ii) instances of real practical irrationality are explained by an error made by the agent within the goal-directed cycle itself. This amounts to reducing all forms of practical irrationality to forms of theoretical irrationality. I will argue, contra (ii), that the agent often represents an action option as having the highest expected utility for attaining a goal, but nevertheless does not implement such representation into the goal-directed cycle, thereby acting in ways that, by their own lights, do not have the highest expected utility. In these cases, the error is not contained within the goal-directed cycle itself, but consists of the failure to choose what the agent deems to have the highest expected utility. This should make us doubtful of Moors‚Äô claim that emotions are not required for making sense of the practical irrationality of emotional episodes. It might turn out that we indeed need the concept of emotion in explaining cases of practical irrationality that do not hinge on the theoretical irrationality of the goal-directed process itself. If so, emotional behaviors differ in kind from garden-variety goal-directed behaviors.\n¬†\nTitle: The Human Affectome\nTime: 16:54-17:02\nAuthors: Yu, Alessandra N. C.; Schiller, Daniela; Lowe, Leroy\nAbstract: Theoretical perspectives in the interdisciplinary field of the affective sciences have proliferated rather than converged due to differing assumptions about what human affective phenomena are and how they work. These metaphysical and mechanistic assumptions‚Äîshaped by academic context and values‚Äîhave dictated the field‚Äôs affective constructs and operationalizations. However, an assumption about the purpose of affective phenomena can guide us to a common set of metaphysical and mechanistic assumptions. In this capstone paper, we home in on a nested teleological principle for human affective phenomena in order to synthesize metaphysical and mechanistic assumptions. Under this framework, human affective phenomena can collectively be considered algorithms that either adjust based on the comfort zone (affective concerns) or monitor those adaptive processes (affective features). Those for affective concerns indicate the adaptive relevance of the environment. These can be organized hierarchically according to distance from metabolic impact (immediate to distal), including physiological and operational concerns, and can also act as global summaries of concerns across time, such as trajectory and optimization. Those for affective features monitor how the adaptive process is going on a momentary basis, include valence (how well or not) and arousal (the extent to which various systems are mobilized), and can inform global concerns. This teleologically-grounded framework offers a principled agenda and launchpad for organizing existing perspectives as well as generating new ones. Ultimately, we hope the Human Affectome brings us a step closer to not only an integrated understanding of human affective phenomena‚Äîbut an integrated field for affective research."

In simple terms, meta-emotions are emotions about emotions. From experiencing guilt about being happy or feeling embarrassed about being sad, to feeling happy about being hopeful or being angry at yourself for being angry, meta-emotions are a critical, albeit underexamined, component of the emotional experience that not only influence how emotional states are interpreted but also how they direct cognitive and behavioral responses across a wide range of social contexts. The persuasive potential of emotions has intrigued researchers and thinkers for centuries and yet, several meta-analyses on the relationship between emotions and persuasion report inconsistent and often contradictory findings (e.g., Turner, 2021; Walter, 2019). One possible explanation for these discrepancies is that persuasion research has largely neglected to assess and account for the critical layer of meta-emotions. To fill this empirical and theoretical lacuna, the current project argues that it is worth considering whether, how, and why meta-emotions influence responses to persuasive communication; specifically, how are message processing factors (e.g., message elaboration, counterarguing) and persuasive outcomes (e.g., attitudes, behavioral intentions) impacted by a meta-emotional experience? As a first step toward answering these questions, the current project advances an argument for incorporating meta-emotions into commonly used persuasive frameworks, suggests preliminary approaches to measuring meta-emotions, and articulates an agenda for future research and theory-building.\n¬†\nTitle: Looking into Meta-Emotions: The Manager-Employee Emotion Dialogue from Cross-Cultural Perspective\nTime: 16:38-16:46\nAuthors: Unler, Ela; Caliskan, Sibel\nAbstract: Expressing emotions may not always be comfortable for managers; however, emotional awareness may contribute to employee well-being. In our study, we have aimed to answer ‚Äúhow managers‚Äô feelings about their own emotions (meta-emotions) and recognizing their subordinates‚Äô feelings affect managing diverse emotions at work‚Äù. Based on the meta-emotions scale (Mitmansgruber et al., 2009), participants were requested to provide emotion-laden work experiences within the last month, where they felt anger, compassionate care, interest, shame/contempt, control, and suppression toward themselves. The questions were conveyed by semi-structured interviews. Through an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), we collected the ‚Äúmeta-emotion‚Äù (total of separate 71) work experiences of 13 managers from service and production sectors in Turkey (TR). Meta-emotions are gathered under four basic themes, as in the literature: NN (negative primary, negative secondary), NP (negative primary, positive secondary), PP (positive primary, positive secondary, and PN (positive primary, negative secondary). Besides, two more separate themes, ‚Äúself‚Äù or ‚Äúother‚Äù orientation of emotions, emerged in TR sample: 1)the primary emotions were mainly other-oriented for NN cases (e.g., anger toward subordinates), PP cases (e.g., proud of themselves after recognition by superiors), and PN cases (e.g., suspicious after an unexpected toleration of their mistake by others), 2) and self-oriented in NP cases (e.g., sparing time to themselves after a distressful workday). From cross cultural perspective, we have started collecting data from British managers (with same methodology) to compare the managers‚Äô emotion-orientation. Supported assumptions will be compared and how studying emotions in different contexts contributes to emotion literature will be discussed. Keywords: primary emotions, secondary emotions, meta-emotions, emotional awareness, well-being\n¬†\nTitle: Neural Correlates of Written Emotion Word Processing in Bilinguals: An fNIRS Study\nTime: 16:46-16:54\nAuthors: Ortega Manchego, Daniela Andrea; Dewey, Dan P.\nAbstract: A growing body of literature investigating the neural correlates of emotion word processing has emerged in recent years. Moreover, research on how the processing of written emotional words may differ for bilinguals suggests that emotional word recognition is modulated by language dominance (Ay√ßi√ßegÀái and Harris 2004). Written words represent a suitable means to study emotion processing (Citron, 2012) and, most notably, to tap into the complex interaction between language dominance and the perception of the emotional valence of written words. As a new contribution to the existing literature on emotional word processing, the present study uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore the neural correlates of emotional word processing in Chinese-English bilinguals. Thirty Chinese-English bilingual university students participated in this study. Half of the group were native English speakers who spoke Mandarin Chinese as their second language, and the other half were native Mandarin Chinese speakers who spoke English as their second language. Participants rated the valence of 60 emotion words (taken from Kousta et al., 2009) in their native and second languages. At the same time, brain activity patterns in response to the emotional content of written words were recorded using fNIRS. Behavioral data analysis indicates no statistically significant differences in ratings or response times across groups. Nevertheless, the preliminary analysis of neural data revealed significant differences in brain activity patterns across groups, specifically in location and intensity. Brain areas related to social cognition were activated in response to positive and negative emotion words. These results are intriguing as they suggest that brain activity patterns reflect differences when processing emotion words in a native language compared to a second language. These research findings show that the manipulation of single words is a suitable means to study emotion processing and the intersection between language dominance and emotion valence. Moreover, single words can elicit cortical brain responses comparable to those elicited by pictures and facial expressions. Ay√ßi√ßegÀái, A., & Harris, C. (2004).

At the same time, destructive behavior has frequently been related to psychopathy. Interestingly, throughout the literature on psychopathy, researchers have indicated a relation between psychopathy and a tendency to be bored (i.e.¬†boredom proneness). If this is true, boredom could potentially prompt destructive behavior in psychopathy. However, the assumed relation between boredom and psychopathy remains empirically untested. The purpose of this paper is to address this gap in research on psychopathy. Using both a clinical sample consisting of people with Dissocial Personality Disorder, other diagnoses, and no diagnoses (N = 175) and a non-clinical sample from the general population of the US (N = 301), this paper empirically explores the association between boredom proneness and psychopathy. Results from the two studies reveal that across different samples and six different psychopathy measures, psychopathy is consistently related to boredom proneness. Here, the majority of effect sizes were relatively large (r &gt; .30). In sum, the present work contributes to a better understanding of the construct of psychopathy and points to boredom as a potential motivator of destructive behavior in individuals with psychopathic traits.\n¬†\nTitle: Does Emotional Regulation Have an Impact on the Perception of Body Health and Eating in Food Science College Students?\nTime: 16:38-16:46\nAuthors: Aguilera, Mari ; de Moraes Prata Gaspar, Maria Clara ; Soar, Claudia; Celorio, Ricard; Comas , Oriol; Vidal-Carou, Mari Carmen\nAbstract: The relationship between the emotional process and eating has become a topic of great interest in current literature. Despite, there are still few studies that address topic. The objective of our work is to analyze the difference between emotional regulation between Human Nutrition and Dietetics (HND) and Food Science and Technology (FST) college students, as well as to explore the relationship of emotional regulation with food perceptions. For this, a total of 297 students completed a survey created adhoc to assess food perceptions, and a standardized questionnaire on emotional regulation. The results indicate that there is no difference in emotional regulation between the two grades evaluated, nor between the years of the degree, just as there is no difference between men and women. Moreover, results indicate that a greater capacity for emotional regulation is related to a greater perception of healthy eating, a healthier and less conflictive perception of the body and less bodily control, as well as fewer feelings of guilt related to eating. Therefore, the analysis of emotional regulation seems key to understanding the relationship we build with food and the construction of the perception of our own body, which is why it becomes a relevant target to address in the training of food specialists, as well as, in the prevention and treatment of eating disorders.\n¬†\nTitle: Redefining OCD: A Novel Framework Integrating Anxiety, Compulsivity, and Decision-Making\nTime: 16:46-16:54\nAuthors: Avbersek, Lev K; Moors, Agnes\nAbstract: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) has long been categorized as an anxiety disorder, primarily recognized for persistent, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and corresponding repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions). Historically, anxiety has been central to the understanding and treatment of OCD, because it was attributed the role of mediation between obsessions and compulsions. However, this emphasis on anxiety has blurred the boundary between OCD and other anxiety-related disorders. Recent research (Gillan et al., 2017) has tackled this problem, by exploring the role of habitual processes as a transdiagnostic mechanism to differentiate between various diagnostic categories. In this perspective, habits can play a bridging role between disorders characterized by anxiety (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder) and those characterized by compulsivity (e.g., addiction). However, the evidence regarding the involvement of habitual processes in OCD remains inconclusive. We propose an alternative theoretical framework grounded in the parallel-competitive goal-directed model (Moors et al., 2017) that allows us to integrate the constructs of anxiety and compulsivity. Our model underscores two key deficits in OCD: response-outcome (R-O) contingency rigidity and aversion to discrepancy. Here, anxiety is viewed not as the primary etiological factor but rather as an epiphenomenon of the identified deficits. This shift allows for a mechanistic delineation of different types of seemingly opposing obsessive-compulsive behaviors and has transdiagnostic potential. Adopting this framework deepens our understanding of OCD, surpassing limitations of a habit-oriented view. It places anxiety within a broader perspective of decision-making, prompting a reevaluation of the role of anxiety and uncovering overlooked aspects of OCD etiology.\n¬†\nTitle: Somatoaffective Responses to Emotional Films\nTime: 16:54-17:02\nAuthors: Chentsova Dutton, Yulia; Li, Jiahan\nAbstract: Our bodies play a central role in emotions; however, most studies on emotional reactivity do not measure the experienced somatic changes. Although research suggests a role for beliefs regarding one‚Äôs knowledge of and response to bodily sensations (e.g., interoceptive awareness, somatosensory amplification), we lack sufficient understanding of whether they predict somatic experiences. This study examined the tendency to report bodily sensations in response to emotional stimuli.Participants (N = 292) watched five emotional film clips (calm, amusing, scary, sad, and disgusting) and reported how they felt during each clip, rating their positive and negative emotions (e.g., sadness, happiness) and somatic experiences (e.g., feeling cold, shivers). The tendency to experience bodily sensations was reliable across films. We examined whether interoceptive awareness and somatosensory amplification predicted the intensity, variability, and diversity of reported somatic sensations, beyond the intensity of emotions experienced during the films. We found that the intensity and variability of somatic sensations were predicted by the intensity of experienced positive and negative emotions, with no additional variance predicted by interoceptive awareness and somatosensory amplification. Somatic diversity was also predicted by the intensity of experienced emotions, with additional variance explained by higher interoceptive awareness. These results suggest individual differences in the inclination to experience intense, variable and diverse bodily sensations in response to emotional stimuli, with this tendency partly explained by the intensity of emotional response and, for diversity, interoceptive awareness. Future work will examine whether these findings hold across cultures and samples of people with high levels of emotional distress.\n¬†\nTitle: Social-Emotional Outcomes in Emerging Adults with ADHD: Exploring Self-Compassion, Interpersonal Concerns, and Psychological Distress\nTime: 17:02-17:10\nAuthors: Hussain, Alia; Abela, Katrina R; Law, Danielle\nAbstract: Emerging adulthood, a critical developmental stage between the ages of approximately 18 and 29, encompasses social skill growth, goal attainment, greater independence, and cognitive development influenced by environment and experience. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), affecting approximately 5 to 8% of emerging adults (EA), is associated with adverse interpersonal experiences. Thus, EAs with ADHD are at a higher risk for unfavourable developmental outcomes, potentially mitigated by self-compassion, as seen in typically developing (TD) populations. This work examined whether and how ADHD predicted peer rejection (PR) and rejection sensitivity (RS; i.e., a learned disposition to be extremely sensitive to perceived or real criticism and rejection) compared to TD EAs, how these respective relationships contributed to psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, and perceived personal stress levels), and how self-compassion might moderate this relationship. Participants for this study included 604 EAs between the ages of 17 and 22 (nADHD = 315) who completed an online questionnaire. Results revealed that ADHD predicted frequent PR experiences and higher RS levels. Moreover, self-compassion decreased stress when individuals reported more PR incidences but increased anxiety and stress when individuals reported higher RS levels. Within-group moderation analyses yielded different effects, implying that self-compassion differentially influences the impact of PR and RS on psychological distress in EAs with ADHD and their TD peers. These results may be explained by well-documented nervous system dysregulation in people with ADHD. These findings have implications for the emotional and social cognitive development of and developing preventative and therapeutic interventions fostering self-compassion for youth with ADHD."

Therefore, the first aim of this preliminary work was to research if emotion recognition in emojis and in faces are distinct abilities. Additionally, we investigated if emotion recognition in emojis and faces are similarly influenced by a facial mimicry instruction in combination with trait empathy. The online study included 690 participants who completed emotion recognition tasks twice in one session, with a random assignment to an experimental group receiving a mimicry instruction or a control group receiving an attention instruction the second time. Results of confirmatory factor analyses showed separate but correlated emotion recognition abilities for emojis and faces. Moreover, latent mean change analyses using multi-group structural equation models revealed an improvement in emotion recognition in emojis in both groups. The improvement in the control group was larger than in the experimental group. The emotion recognition in faces only improved in the control group which was moderated by cognitive empathy. The benefits from the attention instruction were greater for individuals with lower cognitive empathy compared to those with higher cognitive empathy levels. The results of the current study suggest that emotion recognition in emojis and faces are two distinct abilities with differing underlying mechanisms.\n¬†\nTitle: Associations Between Social Media Use and Negative Affect among Young, Middle-Aged, and Older Adults\nTime: 16:38-16:46\nAuthors: Miller, Lisa MS; Huo, Meng\nAbstract: Social networking sites, such as Facebook and X (Twitter), are increasingly popular among older adults (Auxier & Anderson, 2021). This may be in part because these sites offer opportunities for social connectedness, which can be restricted in later life due to age-related decreases in physical mobility (Cotton et al., 2013). Although the literature indicates that social media use can improve feelings of social connectedness (Ballantyne et al., 2010; Bell et al., 2013; Sheldon, 2012), the potential dark side, such as negative affect, is less well-researched. Greater social media use has been associated with higher levels of negative emotion in young adults (Aalbers et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2016), but research also suggests the harm may be less evident with age (Sewall et al., 2022). We examined age differences in the association between social media use and negative affect (little interest, hopeless, nervousness, and worrying) in a nationally representative sample of 14,306 U.S. adults aged 18‚Äì104. Using generalized linear models for complex samples, we observed a significant age √ó social-media-use interaction on participants‚Äô overall negative affect, indicating larger differences between social media users and nonusers at younger relative to older ages (after controlling for demographic variables). Younger-adult users reported higher levels of negative affect than nonusers, whereas older-adult users and nonusers showed similarly low levels of negative affect. Together with past work showing benefits of social media use on social connectedness, this study identifies the unique role social media use may play in promoting older adult mental health.\n¬†\nTitle: Exploring Sensory Modalities to Simulate Touch from a Virtual Agent\nTime: 16:46-16:54\nAuthors: Richard, Gr√©goire; Thouvenin, Indira; Boucaud, Fabien; Pelachaud, Catherine\nAbstract: Social interactions are multi-factorial by nature, and engage multiple sensory channels, through visual, audio, and touch. Particularly, touch allows communicating emotions. Integrating social touch in virtual reality (VR) with virtual agents (VA) requires haptic feedback, which is technologically invasive. Previous work (de Lagarde et al, 2023) has shown that touch can be substituted by other senses, such as audio, and still be perceived as socio-emotional intentions. Our aim is to explore the perception of visual/audio/tactile feedback during social interactions with VAs on the recognition of social touch gestures, their underlying intentions and emotions. We are exploring how the different sensory modalities drive recognition of social gestures together, and separately. We hypothesize participants perceive social touch the most under the congruent combination of visual, audio and tactile feedback. In their work, De Lagarde and colleagues (2023) proposed and validated audio recordings of different social touch gestures. We first designed tactile patterns based on the audio recordings (stroking, tapping and hitting), using a matrix of actuators fitted on a user‚Äôs arm. With a first preliminary experiment, involving only tactile and audio stimuli, we tuned the parameters of those tactile patterns. We are designing a VR experiment where a VA touches participants, using motions representing the different social touch gestures, combining congruent and incongruent visuo-audio-tactile stimuli. The expected results are to provide insight regarding the parameters to elicit the perception of social touch through visual and audio feedback, and how sensory substitution and perceptual supplementation can be implemented for a VA to plausibly touch users in VR.\n¬†\nTitle: Investigating Pupil Mimicry in Pet Dogs\nTime: 16:54-17:02\nAuthors: Lonardo, Lucrezia; Jaasma, Linda; Radovanovic, Kia; Zijlstra, Tonko; V√∂lter, Christoph; Huber, Ludwig; Kret, Mariska\nAbstract: Pupil mimicry happens when the pupils in the eyes of two interacting partners converge towards the same size. This phenomenon has been considered at the basis of the human ability to detect and share emotions, it enhances cooperation between social partners, but its function and evolutionary origins remain debated. While there is evidence that humans resonate with other species‚Äô emotions to some extent, the pupil mimicry effect was found to be stronger between conspecifics than between members of different species in humans and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). With the present eye-tracking study, we are investigating whether pet dogs (Canis familiaris) show pupil mimicry in response to animations of conspecific and human eyes showing constricting and dilating pupils. The dog-human dyad constitutes an interesting model to address pupil mimicry between members of different species due to their shared evolutionary history. First domesticated animals, dogs have become one of the (evolutionarily) most successful species, colonizing the globe alongside humans, helping us with several activities, from herding to assisting people with disabilities. Moreover, human faces are highly familiar and salient for dogs. After months of training, dogs‚Äô eye-movements and pupil sizes are now being recorded in two different labs. If pupil mimicry has evolved as a mechanism facilitating inter-species communication and cooperation, we expect dogs‚Äô pupils to be larger when watching conspecific and human pupils that dilate compared to when watching the same pupils constrict. This study has the potential to reveal whether the ability to automatically empathise with other species is uniquely human.\n¬†\nTitle: Do Threatening Faces Hold Attention Automatically? Evidence from an Eye-Tracking Study\nTime: 17:10-17:18\nAuthors: Severom, Mario Carlo M; Mulckhuyse, Manon\nAbstract: Swiftly responding to threatening cues in the environment is vital for survival. While existing research indicates the automatic attentional capture of threatening faces, the automaticity of delayed attentional disengagement by task-irrelevant threatening faces remains unexplored. As such, this study employs an eye-tracking methodology to investigate the influence of threatening and non-threatening facial expressions as task-irrelevant cues within contexts of varying working memory load. Sixty participants perform an adapted spatial cueing paradigm where their saccadic response latencies to neutral peripheral targets are compared when either a task-irrelevant angry or a neutral facial expression is presented at fixation, while at the same time maintaining either 1 digit or 6 digits in working memory. Moreover, the study examines the impact of trait anxiety on attentional disengagement from threatening faces, building upon prior findings of attentional bias in high anxious individuals. We expect participants to display longer saccadic latencies when an angry face is presented in comparison to a neutral face, irrespective of the working memory load condition. Additionally, we expect this pattern to be more pronounced in high anxious individuals than their low anxious counterparts. Overall, the findings of the study at hand can deepen current understanding of the automaticity involved in attentional processing of threatening faces and offers valuable insights into addressing attentional bias in anxious individuals.\n¬†\nTitle: Emotion and Eye Contact as Joint Primers of the Gaze-Cueing Effect\nTime: 17:18-17:26\nAuthors: Guillin, Amandine; Vergilino-Perez, Dorine; Chaby, Laurence\nAbstract: Efficient processing of others‚Äô gaze direction is essential for the detection of environmental clues and is a key mechanism in nonverbal communication. The tendency for individuals to automatically shift their attention in the direction of someone else‚Äôs gaze is known as the gaze-cueing effect and is typically reflected in faster reaction times when detecting targets that are being looked at, as opposed to targets that are being looked away from. While some authors have found that emotional expressions do not modulate the gaze-cueing effect (Coy et al., 2018; Uono et al., 2022), others have established influences of expressed emotions from an early age (Nied≈∫wiecka & Tomalski, 2015), and demonstrated a priming effect of threatening faces (Ishikawa et al., 2021). Factors such as the prior establishment of a direct eye contact or the individual traits of the observer (e.g., anxiety) also seem to modulate the visuo-spatial orientation of attention and could thereby increase the gaze-cueing effect (Dalmaso et al., 2020; Kaur et al., 2023). Using eye-tracking technology, we aim to explore how emotional facial expressions (happiness, anger, disgust and neutral) and eye contact (direct vs.¬†averted gaze) jointly facilitate or inhibit ocular saccades in a gaze-cueing task. We also seek to investigate the potential effects of the avoidance temperament (Elliot & Thrash, 2002) - characterized by an emotional hypervigilance - on these attentional processes. Our results emphasize the importance of socio-emotional cues in the establishment of joint attention, and their relevance to the development of defensive or social bonding strategies."

Interestingly, happiness is not only a positive emotion, it also evokes the behavioral tendency of approach, which, together with valence, may push towards more risky behavior. To test this hypothesis we picked two emotion dyads, based on the Plutchik‚Äôs taxonomy of emotions (1982), happiness-sadness and anger-fear, with only one of the dyads differing in valence, but both of them differing in the evoked emotional tendency. Using emotionally charged pictures to evoke affect, we conducted two experiments which tested the influence of the aforementioned emotions on the risky decisions taken in a game of chance. In the conditions of unlimited time of presentation of the affective pictures, the emotions influenced both the decisions and reaction times, with participants in the condition of happiness predictably taking the most risky decisions in the shortest time. When the presentation time of the stimuli had been limited, the emotions had impact only on the reaction times, with anger evoking the fastest reactions. In both experiments participants played more risky and faster after winning in the previous round. The results of the experiments show the importance of exploring the influence of behavioral tendencies evoked by emotions on decision making in risky and ambiguous situations, especially in the context of games involving gambling, where emotionally charged graphics are an integral part of the decision environment.\n¬†\nTitle: The Reduced Ability to Detect Pain Expressions on the Faces of Black Individuals is Linked with a Strict Decision Criterion Rather than Sensitivity to Visual Information\nTime: 16:38-16:46\nAuthors: S√©n√©cal, Daphn√©e; Saumure, Camille; Plouffe-Demers, Marie-Pier; Fiset, Daniel; Gosselin, Fr√©d√©ric; Blais, Caroline\nAbstract: Studies reveal that the pain experienced by individuals of Black ethnicity is underestimated in countries where most individuals are of White ethnicity. Moreover, when it comes to detecting pain based on facial expressions, White observers have more difficulty with Black faces compares to White faces. This detection of pain in facial expressions involves at least two processes: the sensitivity to the visual information embedded in pain facial expressions and the criteria used to ascertain that a face genuinely conveys pain. The present study aims at verifying if the difficulty at detecting pain in faces of Black ethnicity is associated with an altered sensitivity, an altered criterion, or both. We conducted a series of four experiments where participants saw either Black or White faces depicting pain facial expressions or neutrality. On each trial, participants had to determine whether the face displayed pain or not (Exp. 1,3,4) or they were asked to decide which of two faces was expressing pain (Exp. 2a and 2b). For experiments 1, 2a and 2b, White participants (n=150) from predominantly White countries were recruited on Prolific. In experiments 3 and 4, White participants (n=100) coming from predominantly white countries, and Black participants (n=100) coming from predominantly Black countries were recruited. Overall, the impairment in detecting pain in Black faces is mostly associated with an altered criterion. Consequently, further studies should explore the theoretical implications of these results, specifically considering the potential contribution of our mental representations and expectations concerning the pain experienced by Black ethnicity.\n¬†\nTitle: Loss Aversion, not Risk Aversion: The Impact of Incidental Emotions\nTime: 16:46-16:54\nAuthors: Treiss, Stephan; Pothos, Emmanuel; Corr, Philip; White, Lee\nAbstract: This study explores the effects of specific emotions ‚Äî happiness, sadness, fear, and anger ‚Äî on Loss Aversion and Risk Aversion through two experiments. Utilising a Prospect-theory inspired model, Loss and Risk Aversion are estimated. The first experiment adopts a between-participants design, while the second allows for an exploration of changes in Loss and Risk Aversion, along with associated incidental emotions, within participants across two sessions. The results indicate that incidental emotions have a more pronounced influence on Loss Aversion rather than Risk Aversion. Some consistency across the two experiments was observed, with happiness and fear demonstrating an inclination to increase Loss Aversion, while the relationship with sadness proved more variable. Some preliminary exploration into potential explanations for this pattern of results is offered. Interestingly, while group emotions of sadness have previously shown a negative correlation with Loss Aversion (Hermalin & Isen, 2008; Isen et al., 1988), the individual experience of feeling ‚Äúblue‚Äù positively correlates with Loss Aversion in the second experiment. The study also delves into whether control variables, such as personality traits or anxiety (Charpentier et al., 2016), mediate the relationship between incidental emotions and Loss Aversion, but we cannot offer concrete conclusions from the present results. In summary, this study illuminates the impact of incidental emotions on Loss and Risk Aversion, contributing to a better understanding of decision-making influencers and potential avenues for improvement.\n¬†\nTitle: Infant-Centered Behavioral Response Patterns to Discrete Emotions\nTime: 16:54-17:02\nAuthors: √ñzden, Zeynep B; Reschke, Peter; Walle, Eric A\nAbstract: Responding to others‚Äô emotions entails the coordination of multiple behaviors. Yet, research on such responding typically analyses each behavior separately. We investigated the heterogeneity of 16-, 19-, and 24-month-old infants‚Äô (N = 296) behavioral response patterns to 5 discrete emotions (joy, sadness, fear, anger, disgust) during a naturalistic interaction. Various infant behaviors (social avoidance, security seeking, stimulus exploration, prosocial responding, information seeking, relaxed play) in response to the emotional context were coded. A latent class analysis (LCA) was then used to reveal groups of individuals that shared commonalities in their behavioral response patterns across the sample. Next, a GLMM examined differences in class prevalence across discrete emotions, age groups, and across age groups within emotions. The LCA revealed 4 distinct classes of infants (Table 1): Prosocial Explorers (19.4%), Information Seeker-Explorers (42.5%), Cautious Information Seekers (19.6%), and Relaxed Players (18.3%). The GLMM revealed several interesting differences in the frequency of each class across emotions and ages. Notably, there was a main effect of emotion for Prosocial Explorers F(4, 365) = 3.40, p = 0.01, and Relaxed Players F(4, 294) = 6.18, p &lt; .001, a main effect of age for Relaxed Players, F(2, 212) = 6.79, p = .001, and a significant interaction effect for Information Seeker-Explorers F(8, 438) = 2.51, p = .01, and Cautious Information Seekers F(8, 320) = 3.05, p = .003. (See Table 2 for pairwise comparisons). This is the first study to utilize an infant-centered analysis to identify subgroups of individuals with similar patterns of goal-directed behaviors in response to discrete emotions.\n¬†\nTitle: The Hateful People: Populist Attitudes Predict Interpersonal and Intergroup Hate\nTime: 17:02-17:10\nAuthors: Mart√≠nez, Cristhian A.; van Prooijen, Jan-Willem; Van Lange, Paul\nAbstract: Do populist attitudes predict a growth in feelings of hate? Or does experiencing hate predicts a growth in populist attitudes? Previous research has not yet examined the relation between populist attitudes and hate feelings over time. Drawing on the match between previous theorizing on the nature of hate and the main features of populism, we propose that the populist worldview meets particularly well the conditions for the emergence of hate feelings over time (and not the other way around). To examine this, we conducted a two-wave study with a large pre-stratified Dutch adult sample in the Netherlands and tested the time-extended associations between populism and hate, thereby focusing on other individuals (N = 943) or groups (N = 851) as targets of hate. Using cross-lagged panel models for interpersonal and intergroup hate, results revealed that hate feelings and populist attitudes are stable over time, that they are positively associated and its association is stable over time, and as expected, that earlier populist attitudes predict later feelings of hate, while the reverse associations were virtually absent. The findings highlight the intense and strong negative feelings that the populist worldview can inspire among people, and illuminate how the populist strategy intended to gain supporters, both from the left and right, may fuel further antagonism, division, and prolonged hate in societies.\n¬†\nTitle: Do Emotional Carryover Effects Carry Over?\nTime: 17:10-17:18\nAuthors: Masters, Nikhil; Lloyd, Tim; Starmer, Chris\nAbstract: Existing research has demonstrated carryover effects whereby emotions generated in one context influence decisions in other, unrelated ones. We examine the carryover effect in relation to valuations of risky and ambiguous lotteries with a novel focus on the comparison of carryovers arising from a targeted stimulus (designed to elicit a specific emotion) with those arising from a naturalistic stimulus (expected to produce a more complex emotional response). We find carryover effects using both types of stimuli, but they are stronger for the naturalistic stimulus and in the context of ambiguity, providing a proof of concept that carryover effects can be observed when moving away from highly stylised settings. These effects are also gender-specific with only males being susceptible. To probe the emotional foundations of the carryover effect, we conduct analysis relating individual self-reports of emotions to valuation behaviour. Our results cast doubt on some previously claimed links between specific incidental emotions and risk taking."
