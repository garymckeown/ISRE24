    "text": "A growing body of research indicates that social media use may be contributing to young people’s poor mental health around the world. However, given the ubiquity of social media apps and their extensive integration into daily life, it is not viable to ask a young person to completely abstain from social media. Rather, a more pragmatic approach is to examine psychological risk factors associated with social media use that might predispose some individuals to be at greater risk for experiencing poor mental health in the first place.\nThis pre-conference will focus on the experience and regulation of emotions in online contexts (including social media apps) and attendant effects on mental health and wellbeing among youth and young adults. Specifically, the first talk will discuss neural correlates of emotion regulation, as measured by EEG, and links to adolescents’ preference for online (versus in-person) social interactions and social anxiety symptoms. The second talk will highlight the importance of young people’s exposure to fast-paced content on social media and downstream impacts on mental health and wellbeing. The third talk demonstrates how machine learning methods can be applied to people’s music preferences on Spotify to establish digital “traces” of risk factors for depression and aid in early detection and prevention efforts for depression and other conditions. Collectively, the findings featured in this pre-conference represent a promising and timely new avenue for the study of emotion regulation and the field of affective science more broadly.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned talks, the pre-conference will also feature a series of data blitz presentations by trainees and early career researchers (see below for submission instructions). The event will conclude with a panel-style Q&A and to promote further discussion, professional networking, and potential research collaborations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Non-verbal vocalisations in human-human and human-machine interactions play important roles in displaying social and affective behaviours and in managing the flow of interaction. Laughter, sighs, clicks, filled pauses, and short utterances such as feedback responses are among some of the non-verbal vocalisations that are being increasingly studied from various research fields. However, much is still unknown about the phonetic or visual characteristics of non-verbal vocalisations (production/encoding), their relations to the social actions they are part of, their perceived meanings (perception/decoding), and their ordering in interaction. Furthermore, with the increased interest for more naturalness in human-machine interaction, current times also invite exploring how these phenomena can be integrated in speech applications.\nThe workshop would be in its 7th edition, with previous editions held in Saarbrücken (2007), Berlin (2009), Dublin (2012), Enschede (2015), Paris (2018), and Bielefeld (2020). The goal of this series of workshops is to bring together scientists from diverse research areas and to provide an exchange forum for interdisciplinary discussions in order to gain a better understanding of laughter and other non-verbal vocalisations.\nResearch themes include, but are not restricted to, these aspects of laughter and other non-verbal vocalisations:\nResearchers are invited to submit extended abstracts (2 pages of content and maximum one additional page for references and figures) describing original work, including work in progress.\nThere will be two keynote presentations on the topics treated by the workshop, delivered by Prof. Carolyn McGettigan (University College London, UK) and Prof. Margaret Zellers (Kiel University, Germany)."

    "title": "Emotional Development Preconference",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Emotional development is a topic that lends itself to study at several levels of analysis and in terms of many interacting influences, and merits consideration of both individual and group differences. While research examining emotional development has traditionally been interspersed throughout ISRE meetings, the Emotional Development Preconference provides an opportunity to integrate these diverse perspectives. This event has been part of the past two ISRE meetings, at each well-attended by researchers from various theoretical, methodological, cultural, and institutional backgrounds. The results have consistently been a program that generated cross-disciplinary interaction and discussion.\nThe present pre-conference seeks to build upon this momentum through a collection of invited speakers who examine emotional development through multiple lenses. In keeping with the ethos of ISRE, the proposed pre-conference will bring together people from different countries and disciplines to focus on a central theme: Language and Emotional Development.\nKnowledge about, experiences of, and competencies for emotion change as individuals develop over the lifespan and as cultures evolve over historical time. How does the language used for emotion track these changes? What role might it play in maintaining or even precipitating them? Six invited speakers from a broad range of disciplines and stances will engage with these questions, among others, as they present research on language and emotional development. Focusing on individual development, their talks will explore how emotion words and caregiver interactions may scaffold emotion knowledge and experience in infants and young children, how fostering social and emotional skills may promote healthy behavioural and relational dynamics, and how these processes are shaped by cultural context. Focusing on cultural development, speakers will examine how words for emotion take on new meanings, how cross-cultural contact may impact language for emotion, and how these processes may subsequently influence development at the individual level. A discussant will conclude the program by considering how the confluence of these person- and culture-level approaches might tackle outstanding questions and tensions about the role of language in emotional development. The audience will have the opportunity to hear from, and interact with, a diverse array of experts and perspectives on emotional development, stimulating discussion and collaboration across disciplines and frameworks.\nAs at past Emotional Development Preconferences, submissions for flash talks and poster presentations are also solicited to encourage researchers of multiple disciplines and career stages to attend and present their research. All submissions will be evaluated by at least 2 experts of emotional development, and flash talk submissions not accepted will be considered for poster presentations. The preconference will also feature a “Best Poster Award” to the top presented poster, as evaluated by the invited speakers. Additionally, the program will include planned breaks for coffee/refreshments to allow attendees to discuss the presentations, form possible collaborations, and network with one another."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Emotions are inherently social, in that they are heavily influenced by interactions with others. Most of the time, they arise, evolve, and are managed in the company of and by others, whose emotions, in turn, become impacted by us as well. Fortunately, there is a growing awareness of how intertwined emotions and interpersonal relationships are, and research on this topic is rapidly increasing. In light of this evolution, this pre-conference focusses on emotions in the context of interpersonal relationships, with a particular emphasis on its dynamic nature. It will feature a series of talks presenting cutting-edge research. Keynotes and flash talks will span across multiple domains, including a wide spectrum of emotions and interpersonal relationships, such as parent-child interactions, romantic relationships and leader-member exchanges. Keynote speakers (see below) are invited experts from different fields, ranging from broader social psychology to clinical and family science. Additionally, there will be a debate about the current state and future of the field, and we are honored to announce that prof. dr. Agneta Fischer will conclude this exciting day as a discussant.\nThrough this program, we aim to exchange knowledge on the intricate ways in which emotions shape and are shaped by interpersonal relationships, and to identify key research gaps in this rapidly expanding field. Our goal is to bring together researchers from all stages and disciplines, fostering connection and interdisciplinary collaboration over this important topic.\nWe will be accepting abstract submissions for flash talk presentations (5-minute talks with 5 minutes for Q&A). Presentations should address the topic of emotions in the context of interpersonal relationships, preferably assessing research questions in a dynamic way. The abstract can be a maximum of 500 words and should outline the goals of the research, the methods used, and a summary of the results. Acceptance as a flash talk will be decided after review by the organizers, based on the fit with the main theme and with other talks."

She studies topics related to the spectrum of connections we have with others, from loneliness and secrecy to successful interpersonal emotion regulation and shared identity. In her talk, Katie will discuss emotion goals for experience and expression as a lens for understanding this range of social experiences.\nDr. Reuma Gadassi-Polack (Tel Aviv-Yaffo Academic College & Yale University) examines the interpersonal and neurobiological basis of typical and atypical emotion regulation, with a special focus on depression development. Her current research deals with emotional reactions to social feedback from parents and peers during the transition to adolescence and the potential protective roles of emotion regulation and social interpretation flexibility. Dr. Gadassi-Polack will talk about how coming from the background of studying emotions in romantic relationships influenced her research on emotions in the parent-adolescent relationship.\nDr. Tammy English (Washington University in St. Louis) conducts research on emotion and emotion regulation across adulthood from an interpersonal perspective. She studies the ways that social context and socially-oriented motives impact how emotions are managed in daily interactions, as well as the interrelationship between emotion regulation and social functioning. In her talk, Tammy will focus on emotion regulation in romantic relationships and novel ways to capture the dynamic interplay between partners that impact well-being.\ndiscussant: Prof. Dr. Agneta Fischer is Professor in Emotions and Affective Processes at the University of Amsterdam. Her broad research interest is emotions in social contexts, and she has published in the domain of facial expressions of emotion, emotional mimicry, culture and gender differences in emotions, social emotion regulation and the social functions of emotions. She will be the discussant in the symposium."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Whether through news, art, social media, or even in professional settings or walking on the street, people can be confronted with the suffering of others. Although other people’s suffering can evoke strong emotions (e.g., fear, outrage, sadness), people do not seem to consistently avoid such content. Engaging with the suffering of other people involves different psychological and affective processes. Through this preconference we aim to bring together scholars from different disciplines (i.e., social psychology, media psychology, criminology, neuroscience) to discuss how their research can help understand when people do, and do not, engage with a suffering other. How do people derive meaning from other people’s stories of suffering? Why do people seek out information that can evoke intense emotional reactions? When do people choose to experience empathy and when (and how) do they choose to regulate empathy? How do people respond to violent street incidents? Research on eudaimonia, empathy, curiosity and prosociality, will shed light on the affective processes, motives and outcomes of engaging with the suffering of others.\nOur goal is to bring together both senior and junior researchers to discuss the theme of the preconference from different interdisciplinary perspectives. The program will include 5 invited speakers (from different disciplines and regions) that will present their work in 45-minute talks, leaving plenty of time for questions and discussion. Moreover, we invite submissions for short talks from researchers of all levels and disciplines. For more information and submission guidelines, please see https://sites.google.com/view/isre2024sufferingpreconference"

    "text": "Confirmed speakers\nAnne Bartsch (Leipzig University) specializes in research on media uses and effects, with a special focus on media entertainment and emotional media effects. Her current research deals with the appeal of moving and thought-provoking media experiences and with the effects of such experiences on individuals’ issue involvement, information seeking, and political participation concerning the issues portrayed.\nSuzanne Oosterwijk (University of Amsterdam) is interested in a phenomenon called morbid curiosity (i.e., seeking out images, videos, and stories that detail death, violence, or harm). She will discuss epistemic, eudaimonic, social and affective motives that may explain why people engage with emotionally evocative content.\nDaryl Cameron (Pennsylvania State University) studies why and how people are motivated to empathetically engage with or avoid others’ suffering. Decisions whether or not to share in others’ experiences are based on how people consider costs and benefits of empathy and enact different emotion regulation strategies. He will summarize his work using the empathy selection task to explore motivated empathy regulation about suffering through the lens of situation selection.\nLasana Harris (University College London) studies dehumanised perception as a proactive emotion regulation strategy. His research demonstrates that people predict empathy requirements in impending social interactions and dehumanise when they expect the social interaction to be emotionally taxing. He will discuss research documenting that medical professions engage dehumanised perception to stave off burnout and facilitate better care for their patients.\nMarie Rosenkrantz Lindegaard (Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement) has a background in cultural anthropology and criminology. Her pioneering work on bystander behavior challenged the assumption that bystanders are passive agents, showing that intervention during conflicts, rather than apathy, is the norm."

If your submission for a symposium is accepted, you will give an oral presentation.\nAs ISRE 2024 is an in-person conference, we expect all presenters to attend the conference to present in person.\nLIMIT ON NUMBER OF SUBMISSIONS: In order to encourage a diversity of speakers and research perspectives, ISRE limits participants to one oral presentation per first author. Attendees can be listed as a co-author on multiple presentations, and speakers can also participate separately in symposia as a discussant.\nAll submissions must be written in English and will be subject to double-blind peer review by an international scientific committee. In order to facilitate the review process, submissions should indicate one or more keywords that describe the work. A list of keywords can be found here."

    "text": "Symposium submission guidelines\nSymposium sessions consist of a number of presenters discussing a common topic or theme in a manner that brings new insights to the subject. Submissions are welcome from scholars in all relevant disciplines for symposia of up to four talks and one discussant or five talks without a discussant. Submissions that include multiple disciplines are particularly encouraged in order to facilitate cross-disciplinary exchange. Each presenter in a symposium will be allocated 15 minutes plus three minutes for questions. Symposia presentations can involve co-authors, who will be listed in the printed program.\nIn order to propose a symposium, the lead proposer will need the name and affiliation of the symposium presenters, co-authors, and discussant, if one is used. They will also need a symposium abstract no longer than 250 words explaining why the talks should be linked, and each presenter ’s abstract, which should be a maximum of 250 words. An individual can present only once at the conference as first-author but can be a co-author or discussant on multiple submissions.\nIn order to support the double-blind review process, you will need to prepare a PDF file that includes the symposium’s contents but excludes presenter names. The PDF file should contain the symposium title and description (250 words max), followed by a title and abstract for each individual talk (250 words max). If a discussant is involved, the PDF should explicitly include this statement: “This symposium includes a discussant.”  The submission should be appropriately anonymized in order to avoid revealing either the authors’ identity or institution. Please see anonymization instructions here."

    "text": "Detailed Submission Instructions\nTo upload your submissions, visit the SUBMISSION SITE. Abstracts should be submitted by the first author. Symposia should be submitted by the lead symposia proposer. The submitting author should create a new CMT account and use that to submit one submission at most, unless they are submitting a symposia in the role of a dissussant. Once you have created an account, you will be taken to the author console page, where you can enter your submission.\nStep 1: In the author console click on the “’+ Create new submission” button (see Figure 1). Enter the title in the text box marked “Title.” The person submitting the abstract should paste the 250-word abstract in the text box marked “Abstract” (see Figure 2). Symposia presenters should leave the abstract field empty. You will upload a PDF file at a later stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Create a new submission in the Author Console\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Input the title and Abstact (Syposia only need a title)\n\n\n\nStep 2: Enter the email address of the first author. The first author’s first name, last name, and organization fields will populate automatically (see Figure 3). Add the email address of the first co-author and fill in their first name, last name, organization, and country; you will need to click the blue “+Add” button to confirm their details (see Figure 4). If they already have an account, their details will populate automatically. Use the grey “+Add” button to add co-authors. For abstracts, enter the authors in the order that you wish them to appear in the final program. You can use the arrows to the right to change the order. Use the radio button to the left to indicate the primary contact, who should be the intended speaker. For symposia, enter the names of all planned speakers, co-authors, and the discussant, if one is included, in any order. For abstracts and symposia, co-authors should register their email with the CMT platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Add the first author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Add co-authors (In this case the co-author does not have a CMT account)\n\n\n\nStep 3: Symposia presenters should now upload the PDF file of their submission. That file should contain an anonymous description of the symposia title and the title/abstract of each presentation. It should be uploaded either by using the drag-and-drop box or by clicking on the “Upload from Computer” button (see Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Upload the symposia PDF\n\n\n\nStep 4: Enter the kind of submission you are making—abstract or symposia—and, for abstracts, your preferred presentation format—oral or poster—and the topic keywords. You may select multiple keywords, which will be used to match your submission to reviewers.\nIMPORTANT Step 5: Review your submission and press “Submit”. Your submission will not be completed until you press “Submit.” You may have to scroll down to see the submit button. After successfully submitting, you will receive an email confirming your submission. If you did not receive a confirmation email, your submission may not have been successfully submitted.\nYou may review all your submissions by using logging into the author console in CMT.\nNOTE: Your co-authors will be notified of the submission. It is the submitting author’s responsibility to ensure that co-authors have accounts on CMT.\nIf you have any questions, please contact us."
