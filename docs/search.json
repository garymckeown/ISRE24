    "text": "A growing body of research indicates that social media use may be contributing to young people‚Äôs poor mental health around the world. However, given the ubiquity of social media apps and their extensive integration into daily life, it is not viable to ask a young person to completely abstain from social media. Rather, a more pragmatic approach is to examine psychological risk factors associated with social media use that might predispose some individuals to be at greater risk for experiencing poor mental health in the first place.\nThis pre-conference will focus on the experience and regulation of emotions in online contexts (including social media apps) and attendant effects on mental health and wellbeing among youth and young adults. Specifically, the first talk will highlight links between use of screen media (overall) and social media (in particular), emotion regulation abilities, and wellbeing. The second talk will discuss neural correlates of emotion regulation, as measured by EEG, and links to adolescents‚Äô preference for online (versus in-person) social interactions and social anxiety symptoms. The third talk demonstrates how machine learning methods can be applied to people‚Äôs music preferences on Spotify to establish digital ‚Äútraces‚Äù of risk factors for depression and aid in early detection and prevention efforts for depression and other conditions. Collectively, the findings featured in this pre-conference represent a promising and timely new avenue for the study of emotion regulation and the field of affective science more broadly.\nIn addition to the above-mentioned talks, the pre-conference will also feature a series of data blitz presentations by trainees and early career researchers and two keynote talks about the state of the field and implications for public policy and advocacy work. The event will conclude with a panel-style Q&A and to promote further discussion, professional networking, and potential research collaborations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Emotions are inherently social, in that they are heavily influenced by interactions with others. Most of the time, they arise, evolve, and are managed in the company of and by others, whose emotions, in turn, become impacted by us as well. Fortunately, there is a growing awareness of how intertwined emotions and interpersonal relationships are, and research on this topic is rapidly increasing. In light of this evolution, this pre-conference focusses on emotions in the context of interpersonal relationships, with a particular emphasis on its dynamic nature. It will feature a series of talks presenting cutting-edge research. Keynotes and flash talks will span across multiple domains, including a wide spectrum of emotions and interpersonal relationships, such as parent-child interactions, romantic relationships and leader-member exchanges. Keynote speakers (see below) are invited experts from different fields, ranging from broader social psychology to clinical and family science. Additionally, there will be a debate about the current state and future of the field, and we are honored to announce that prof. dr. Agneta Fischer will conclude this exciting day as a discussant.\nThrough this program, we aim to exchange knowledge on the intricate ways in which emotions shape and are shaped by interpersonal relationships, and to identify key research gaps in this rapidly expanding field. Our goal is to bring together researchers from all stages and disciplines, fostering connection and interdisciplinary collaboration over this important topic.\nWe will be accepting abstract submissions for flash talk presentations (5-minute talks with 5 minutes for Q&A). Presentations should address the topic of emotions in the context of interpersonal relationships, preferably assessing research questions in a dynamic way. The abstract can be a maximum of 500 words and should outline the goals of the research, the methods used, and a summary of the results. Acceptance as a flash talk will be decided after review by the organizers, based on the fit with the main theme and with other talks."

She studies topics related to the spectrum of connections we have with others, from loneliness and secrecy to successful interpersonal emotion regulation and shared identity. In her talk, Katie will discuss emotion goals for experience and expression as a lens for understanding this range of social experiences.\nDr.¬†Reuma Gadassi-Polack (Tel Aviv-Yaffo Academic College & Yale University) examines the interpersonal and neurobiological basis of typical and atypical emotion regulation, with a special focus on depression development. Her current research deals with emotional reactions to social feedback from parents and peers during the transition to adolescence and the potential protective roles of emotion regulation and social interpretation flexibility. Dr.¬†Gadassi-Polack will talk about how coming from the background of studying emotions in romantic relationships influenced her research on emotions in the parent-adolescent relationship.\nDr.¬†Tammy English (Washington University in St.¬†Louis) conducts research on emotion and emotion regulation across adulthood from an interpersonal perspective. She studies the ways that social context and socially-oriented motives impact how emotions are managed in daily interactions, as well as the interrelationship between emotion regulation and social functioning. In her talk, Tammy will focus on emotion regulation in romantic relationships and novel ways to capture the dynamic interplay between partners that impact well-being.\ndiscussant: Prof.¬†Dr.¬†Agneta Fischer is Professor in Emotions and Affective Processes at the University of Amsterdam. Her broad research interest is emotions in social contexts, and she has published in the domain of facial expressions of emotion, emotional mimicry, culture and gender differences in emotions, social emotion regulation and the social functions of emotions. She will be the discussant in the symposium."

Our present ‚Äúage of affectism‚Äù exposes that script as both inaccurate and counterproductive. But what lies beyond it? In this talk, Professor Maroney will present an overview of her multi-year, mixed-methods empirical study into the role of emotion and its regulation in the lives and work of judges in the United States, giving us an early view of portions of her forthcoming book, What Judges Feel: How Emotions Shape Justice.\n\n\nTerry Maroney investigates the intersection of law and emotion. She is also a scholar of criminal law, with specializations in wrongful convictions and in juvenile justice. Professor Maroney‚Äôs work on the role of emotion in judicial behavior and decision-making forms the backbone of her scholarly focus. Weaving legal analysis together with the psychology, sociology and philosophy of emotion, her work illuminates how emotional experiences, dynamics, and their management interact with the constraints and demands of varied judicial roles, with deep implications for judges and the public they serve.

She frequently consults with and presents to judicial audiences in both the United States and abroad. With Judge Jeremy Fogel (now retired) and the Federal Judicial Center, she co-founded a novel intensive seminar focused on the human side of judging, now offered regularly to mid-career federal judges.\nBefore becoming a law professor, Maroney was a litigator with WilmerHale and a Skadden Fellow at the Urban Justice Center, both in New York City; she draws on that practice experience‚Äîwhich included a high-profile triple exoneration, U.S. Supreme Court advocacy, and direct representation of children‚Äîin her teaching and writing. A 1998 summa cum laude graduate of New York University School of Law, Maroney clerked for Judge Amalya L. Kearse on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, has held academic fellowships at the law schools of NYU and the University of Southern California, and from 2016-17 was the Andrew W.

This iconic building, recognised the world over, is often referred to locally as the ‚ÄúHouse on the Hill‚Äù. Opened in 1932 by the then Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VIII, Parliament Buildings is the home of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The beauty of the Building‚Äôs exterior is matched by its equally stunning interior.\nThe Great Hall, where our reception will take place, is made almost entirely from Italian Travertine, and the rich and vibrantly painted ceiling features five stunning chandeliers. The central chandelier was given to Parliament Buildings by Windsor Castle on long-term loan in 1932. This eminent venue has hosted presidents, prime ministers, popstars and royalty, but there can surely be none as illustrious as our friends in ISRE.\nDo join us on what is sure to be a conference to remember, connect with your emotion colleagues, and immerse yourself in the beauty, grandeur and history of Parliament Buildings."

For submitted contributions, we will be accepting extended abstract submissions for Poster and Flash Talk presentations (instructions below). This year‚Äôs focus is ‚ÄúOpportunities, challenges, and impacts of computational methods in emotion research‚Äù.\nThis year, we are also organizing a special session on research using Large Language Models and affective science, across the range of basic and applied research questions, for example: how well do these models understand emotions; what can we learn from the nature/representation of emotions in these models; how can we use these models to generate artificial stimuli, or label data; how can we use these models in applied systems (e.g., for emotional well-being)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Emotional development is a topic that lends itself to study at several levels of analysis and in terms of many interacting influences, and merits consideration of both individual and group differences. While research examining emotional development has traditionally been interspersed throughout ISRE meetings, the Emotional Development Preconference provides an opportunity to integrate these diverse perspectives. This event has been part of the past two ISRE meetings, at each well-attended by researchers from various theoretical, methodological, cultural, and institutional backgrounds. The results have consistently been a program that generated cross-disciplinary interaction and discussion.\nThe present pre-conference seeks to build upon this momentum through a collection of invited speakers who examine emotional development through multiple lenses. In keeping with the ethos of ISRE, the proposed pre-conference will bring together people from different countries and disciplines to focus on a central theme: Language and Emotional Development.\nKnowledge about, experiences of, and competencies for emotion change as individuals develop over the lifespan and as cultures evolve over historical time. How does the language used for emotion track these changes? What role might it play in maintaining or even precipitating them? Six invited speakers from a broad range of disciplines and stances will engage with these questions, among others, as they present research on language and emotional development. Focusing on individual development, their talks will explore how emotion words and caregiver interactions may scaffold emotion knowledge and experience in infants and young children, how fostering social and emotional skills may promote healthy behavioural and relational dynamics, and how these processes are shaped by cultural context. Focusing on cultural development, speakers will examine how words for emotion take on new meanings, how cross-cultural contact may impact language for emotion, and how these processes may subsequently influence development at the individual level. A discussant will conclude the program by considering how the confluence of these person- and culture-level approaches might tackle outstanding questions and tensions about the role of language in emotional development. The audience will have the opportunity to hear from, and interact with, a diverse array of experts and perspectives on emotional development, stimulating discussion and collaboration across disciplines and frameworks.\nAs at past Emotional Development Preconferences, submissions for flash talks and poster presentations are also solicited to encourage researchers of multiple disciplines and career stages to attend and present their research. All submissions will be evaluated by at least 2 experts of emotional development, and flash talk submissions not accepted will be considered for poster presentations. The preconference will also feature a ‚ÄúBest Poster Award‚Äù to the top presented poster, as evaluated by the invited speakers. Additionally, the program will include planned breaks for coffee/refreshments to allow attendees to discuss the presentations, form possible collaborations, and network with one another."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Whether through news, art, social media, or even in professional settings or walking on the street, people can be confronted with the suffering of others. Although other people‚Äôs suffering can evoke strong emotions (e.g., fear, outrage, sadness), people do not seem to consistently avoid such content. Engaging with the suffering of other people involves different psychological and affective processes. Through this preconference we aim to bring together scholars from different disciplines (i.e., social psychology, media psychology, criminology, neuroscience) to discuss how their research can help understand when people do, and do not, engage with a suffering other. How do people derive meaning from other people‚Äôs stories of suffering? Why do people seek out information that can evoke intense emotional reactions? When do people choose to experience empathy and when (and how) do they choose to regulate empathy? How do people respond to violent street incidents? Research on eudaimonia, empathy, curiosity and prosociality, will shed light on the affective processes, motives and outcomes of engaging with the suffering of others.\nOur goal is to bring together both senior and junior researchers to discuss the theme of the preconference from different interdisciplinary perspectives. The program will include 5 invited speakers (from different disciplines and regions) that will present their work in 45-minute talks, leaving plenty of time for questions and discussion. Moreover, we invite submissions for short talks from researchers of all levels and disciplines.

    "text": "Confirmed speakers\nAnne Bartsch (Leipzig University) specializes in research on media uses and effects, with a special focus on media entertainment and emotional media effects. Her current research deals with the appeal of moving and thought-provoking media experiences and with the effects of such experiences on individuals‚Äô issue involvement, information seeking, and political participation concerning the issues portrayed.\nSuzanne Oosterwijk (University of Amsterdam) is interested in a phenomenon called morbid curiosity (i.e., seeking out images, videos, and stories that detail death, violence, or harm). She will discuss epistemic, eudaimonic, social and affective motives that may explain why people engage with emotionally evocative content.\nDaryl Cameron (Pennsylvania State University) studies why and how people are motivated to empathetically engage with or avoid others‚Äô suffering. Decisions whether or not to share in others‚Äô experiences are based on how people consider costs and benefits of empathy and enact different emotion regulation strategies. He will summarize his work using the empathy selection task to explore motivated empathy regulation about suffering through the lens of situation selection.\nLasana Harris (University College London) studies dehumanised perception as a proactive emotion regulation strategy. His research demonstrates that people predict empathy requirements in impending social interactions and dehumanise when they expect the social interaction to be emotionally taxing. He will discuss research documenting that medical professions engage dehumanised perception to stave off burnout and facilitate better care for their patients.\nMarie Rosenkrantz Lindegaard (Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement) has a background in cultural anthropology and criminology. Her pioneering work on bystander behavior challenged the assumption that bystanders are passive agents, showing that intervention during conflicts, rather than apathy, is the norm."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Non-verbal vocalisations in human-human and human-machine interactions play important roles in displaying social and affective behaviours and in managing the flow of interaction. Laughter, sighs, clicks, filled pauses, and short utterances such as feedback responses are among some of the non-verbal vocalisations that are being increasingly studied from various research fields. However, much is still unknown about the phonetic or visual characteristics of non-verbal vocalisations (production/encoding), their relations to the social actions they are part of, their perceived meanings (perception/decoding), and their ordering in interaction. Furthermore, with the increased interest for more naturalness in human-machine interaction, current times also invite exploring how these phenomena can be integrated in speech applications.\nThe workshop would be in its 7th edition, with previous editions held in Saarbr√ºcken (2007), Berlin (2009), Dublin (2012), Enschede (2015), Paris (2018), and Bielefeld (2020). The goal of this series of workshops is to bring together scientists from diverse research areas and to provide an exchange forum for interdisciplinary discussions in order to gain a better understanding of laughter and other non-verbal vocalisations.\nResearch themes include, but are not restricted to, these aspects of laughter and other non-verbal vocalisations:\nResearchers are invited to submit extended abstracts (2 pages of content and maximum one additional page for references and figures) describing original work, including work in progress.\nThere will be two keynote presentations on the topics treated by the workshop, delivered by Prof.¬†Carolyn McGettigan (University College London, UK) and Prof.¬†Margaret Zellers (Kiel University, Germany)."

In order to define that, we have adapted the definition provided by the UK Research Councils to include PhD students. Those criteria refer to those who are :\n\ncurrent PhD students, and those who were awarded their PhD up to eight years ago (this is from the time of the PhD ‚Äòviva‚Äô oral test), or equivalent professional training;\nwithin eight years of being awarded their PhD (this is from the time of the PhD ‚Äòviva‚Äô oral test), or equivalent professional training;\nwithin six years of their first academic appointment, meaning the first full or part-time paid employment contract that lists research or teaching as the primary function.\n\nThose periods exclude any career break that is due to, for example:\n\nfamily care;\nreasons related to COVID-19, such as home schooling or increased teaching load."
