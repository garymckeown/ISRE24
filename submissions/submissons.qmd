If you would like to contribute to ISRE 2024 by presenting your research, submissions are accepted in two categories: **abstracts that** describe an individual research project (which may be accepted as oral or poster presentations) and **symposia** consisting of 4-5 oral presentations on a single research theme. The program committee will make the final determination of the presentation format for abstracts (oral or poster presentation). All accepted symposia will receive oral presentation.

As ISRE 2024 is an in-person conference we expect all presenters to attend the conference and present in person.

**LIMIT ON NUMBER OF SUBMISSIONS:** To encourage diversity of speakers and research perspectives, ISRE limits participants to one oral presentation as a first-author. Attendees can be listed as a co-author on multiple presentations, and speakers can also participate separately as a symposia discussant.

**All submissions must be written in English** and will be subject to **double blind** peer review by an international scientific committee. To facilitate the review process, submissions should indicate one or more keywords describing the content of the work. A list of keywords can be found [here](#SubmissionKeywords).

## Abstract submission guidelines

In order to submit an abstract, the first author should submit the abstract and will need the names, email and affiliations of all co-authors, a title not longer than 15 words, and an abstract not longer than 250 words. The abstract should be anonymized so as not to reveal either the authors' identities or institutions. Please see anonymization instructions [here](#AnonymizationInstructions).

Accepted abstracts will be published in the conference program. If accepted for oral presentation, abstracts will be allocated 15 minutes, plus 3 minutes for questions. Posters will be assigned to dedicated sessions and stay up for one day.

## Symposium submission guidelines

Symposium sessions consist of a number of presenters discussing a common topic or theme in a manner that brings new insights to the subject. Submissions are welcome from scholars in all relevant disciplines for symposia of up to four talks and one discussant or five talks without a discussant. Submissions including multiple disciplines are particularly encouraged to facilitate cross-disciplinary exchange. Each presenter in a symposium will be allocated 15 minutes, plus 3 minutes for questions. Symposia presentations can involve co-authors, and co-authors will be listed in the printed program.

In order to propose a symposium, the lead proposer will need the names and affiliations of the symposium presenters, co-authors and discussant (if one is used), a symposium abstract not longer than 250 words explaining why these talks should be linked, and the abstracts (250 words max) of each individual presenter. An individual can present once at the conference as first-author (but can be a co-author or discussant on multiple submissions).

To support the **double-blind** review process, you will need to prepare a **PDF file** that includes the symposium's contents but **excludes presenter names.** The PDF file should contain the symposium title and description (250 words max), followed by a title and abstract for each individual talk (250 words max). If a discussant is involved, the PDF should explicitly include the statement "This symposium includes a discussant."Â  The submission should be appropriately anonymized not to reveal either the authors' identities or institutions. Please see anonymization instructions [here](#AnonymizationInstructions).

## Detailed Submission Instructions {#DetailedSubmissionInstructions}

To upload your submissions, visit the [**SUBMISSION SITE**](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/User/Login). Abstracts should be submitted by the first author. Symposia should be submitted by the lead symposia proposer. The submitting author should **create a new CMT account** and use this to submit at most one submission (unless you are submitting a symposia in the role of a dissussant). Once you have created an account, you will be taken to the author console page where you can enter your submission.

Step 1: In the author console click on the "'+ Create new submission" button (see @fig-NewSubmission). Enter the title in the text box marked Title. Abstract submitters should paste the 250 word abstract in the text box marked Abstract (see @fig-TitleAbstract). Symposia presenters should leave the abstract field empty (you will upload a PDF file at a later stage).

![Input the title and Abstact (Syposia only need a title)](../images/create-new-submission-page-title-abstract.png){#fig-TitleAbstract}

Step 2: Enter the email address of the first author---the first authors First Name, Last Name, and Organization fileds will populate automatically (see @fig-AddFirstAuthor). Add the email of the first co-author and fill in their First Name, Last Name, Organization, and Country; you will need to click the blue "+Add" button to confirm their details (see @fig-CoauthorNotFound). If they already have an account their details will populate automatically. Use the grey "+Add" button to add additional co-authors. For abstracts, enter the authors in the order you wish them to appear in the final program. You can use the arrows to the right to change the order. Use the radio button to the left to indicate the Primary Contact who should be the intended speaker. For symposia, enter the names of all planned speakers, co-authors and the discussant (if one is included) in any order. For both abstracts and symposia, co-authors should register their email with the CMT platform.

![Add co-authors (In this case the co-author does not have a CMT account)](../images/coauthor-not-found.png){#fig-CoauthorNotFound}

Step 3: Symposia presenters should now upload the PDF file of your submission. It should contain an anonymous description of the symposia title and title/abstract of each presentation. This should be uploaded either using the drag and drop box or by clicking on the "Upload from Computer" button (see @fig-UploadSymposiaPDF).

![Upload the symposia PDF](../images/upload-files.png){#fig-UploadSymposiaPDF}

Step 4: Enter the kind of submission (abstract or symposia) and, for abstracts, the preferred presentation format (oral or poster), and the Topic keywords (you may select multiple keywords, and these will be used to match your submission to reviewers).

**IMPORTANT** Step 5: Review your submission and press "Submit". Your submission will not be completed unless you hit Submit. (You may have to scroll down to see the submit button). After successfully submitting, you will receive an email confirming your submission. **If you did not receive a confirmation email, your submission may not have been successfully submitted.**

You may review all of your submissions by using logging into the Author Console lin CMT.

**NOTE:** Your co-authors will be notified of the submission. It is the submitting author's responsibility to ensure that co-authors have accounts on CMT.

If you have any questions, please [contact us](../contactus/index.qmd)

## Anonymization Instructions {#AnonymizationInstructions}

To prepare an anonymized submission, authors are expected to remove author and institutional identities from the submission. Institution information should also be removed from the body of the text. For instance, use "...participants were recruited from a university campus" instead of "...participants were recruited from Queen's University Belfast campus."

## Early Career Researcher {#EarlyCareerResearcher}

We are interested in whether candidates are early career researchers. To define this we have adapted the definition provided by the UK Research Councils to include PhD students, the criteria are:

-   current PhD students and up to eight years after obtaining their PhD award (this is from the time of the PhD 'viva' oral test), or equivalent professional training

-   within eight years of their PhD award (this is from the time of the PhD 'viva' oral test), or equivalent professional training

-   within six years of their first academic appointment (the first full or part time paid employment contract that lists research or teaching as the primary function).

These periods exclude any career break, for example due to:

-   family care

-   health reasons

-   reasons related to COVID-19 such as home schooling or increased teaching load.
