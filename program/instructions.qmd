## Oral Presentations & Flash Talks

For those giving Oral Presentations, you will be afforded a **12-minute slot for your talk and two minutes for any audience questions**. 

For a Flash Talk, you will be afforded **six minutes for your presentation and two minutes for brief questions**. We will maintain a strict schedule, and you can expect the next speaker to begin to set up as you take questions. 

Speakers can present using the computers in the rooms or their own laptops, and we will provide audio.

Symposia will be moderated by the symposium organizers. Individual talks sessions will be assigned a moderator. Moderators will be communicated in the ISRE2024 program in the next weeks. For oral presentations, please make sure to contact your session moderator before your scheduled session. You may be asked to send your slides in advance. 


## Posters

You are strongly encouraged to set up posters in the morning before the first conference session. You are welcome to leave your poster up till the end of the day. The following are the guidelines for poster presentations:

- Poster size is limited to **121cm x 121cm** (4 x 4 ft, A0 format maximum). Landscape and portrait layouts are both supported. We will provide posterboards and stationery for attaching your poster.

- The boards will contain the **poster number** assigned to your poster so that you will know which board to use.

- Your poster must contain the abstract title and the name(s) of the poster author(s).

- QR codes may be included on posters and handouts so long as the code does not lead to a website or materials promoting or marketing a company or product 

- You should bear in mind that your illustrations will be viewed from distances of 3 feet or more. All lettering should be sized accordingly.
