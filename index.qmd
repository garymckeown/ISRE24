# About the Conference

We are happy to announce that the International Society for Research on Emotion (ISRE) conference will take place **in-person on 17 to 20 July 2024 in Belfast, Northern Ireland**.

The ISRE conference is an exciting opportunity to meet international colleagues, present your work, and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in emotion research. ISRE members study emotions from a wide range of disciplines including affective computing, anthropology, art and design, education, history, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology and sociology.
