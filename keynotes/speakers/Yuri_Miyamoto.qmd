## Culture, Emotion, and Health: Dealing with Emotions in Sociocultural Contexts

People generally want to increase positive emotions and decrease negative emotions. However, the extent to which individuals engage in such emotion regulation varies across cultures, partly due to differing beliefs about emotions. In this talk, I will present research highlighting cultural differences in dialectical versus predominantly adverse valuations of emotions. These variations in emotion valuations lead to cultural differences in emotion regulation and have health implications. I will also discuss sociocultural practices that support emotion beliefs and emotion regulation. By illuminating these processes, I will underscore the active role sociocultural contexts play in shaping emotions and their health implications.

### Bio

Yuri Miyamoto, a Professor in the field of social and personality psychology at Hitotsubashi University, is renowned for her pioneering research on the intricate interplay between culture and psychology. Through her scholarly work, she has unraveled the multifaceted ways in which culture influences our emotional and cognitive processes, with significant implications for our well-being (Miyamoto et al., in press).

Yuri Miyamoto's extensive body of work not only elucidates cultural differences in emotions and cognition but also provides valuable insights into their health-related consequences (Miyamoto et al., 2017). Furthermore, she has delved into the complex web of culture and social hierarchy, uncovering the diverse influences they exert on various psychological processes (Miyamoto et al., 2013). Additionally, her research has shed light on the effects of intercultural interactions, such as acculturation processes, which play a pivotal role in our interconnected world (Miyamoto & Ma, 2011). Yuri Miyamoto's contributions to the field of psychology, as evidenced by her representative publications, have greatly enriched our understanding of how culture shapes our emotional and cognitive experiences (Miyamoto, 2013; Miyamoto & Wilken, 2010).
