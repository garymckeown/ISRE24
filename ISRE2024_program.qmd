# Keynote Speakers

### 18 July: Yuri Miyamoto (9:30 - 10:30)

Yuri Miyamoto, a Professor in the field of social and personality psychology at Hitotsubashi University, is renowned for her pioneering research on the intricate interplay between culture and psychology. Through her scholarly work, she has unraveled the multifaceted ways in which culture influences our emotional and cognitive processes, with significant implications for our well-being (Miyamoto et al., in press).

### 19 July: Phoebe Ellsworth (11:00 - 12:00)

Phoebe Ellsworth is noted for her work in law and psychology. More specifically, she has done research on jury behavior and decision making, public opinion and the death penalty, and eyewitness identification. Her other main research interest is in emotions. Some areas of research in this topic include facial emotions, cognition and emotion, and interpretation of emotion. As a graduate student, she worked with Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen to develop the photographs that were used in their research comparing perceptions of emotional faces across cultures. Phoebe Ellsworth is known for her contributions to appraisal theory, emotions and culture, challenges of emotion and language, and for her writing on William James. In much of her research, Phoebe Ellsworth has intertwined an interest in cultural differences. In particular, she has taken a look at the cultural differences in perceiving facial emotions (Masuda, Ellsworth, Mesquita, Leu, Tanida, and Van de Veerdonk, 2008).

### 20 July: Terry Maroney (11:00 - 12:00)

Terry Maroney investigates the intersection of law and emotion. She is also a scholar of criminal law, with specializations in wrongful convictions and in juvenile justice. Professor Maroney’s work on the role of emotion in judicial behavior and decision-making forms the backbone of her scholarly focus. Weaving legal analysis together with the psychology, sociology and philosophy of emotion, her work illuminates how emotional experiences, dynamics, and their management interact with the constraints and demands of varied judicial roles, with deep implications for judges and the public they serve. Maroney’s many publications in this area—which include “(What We Talk About When We Talk About) Judicial Temperament,” “Angry Judges,” “Emotional Regulation and Judicial Behavior” and “The Persistent Cultural Script of Judicial Dispassion”—have been widely read among the U.S. judiciary. She frequently consults with and presents to judicial audiences in both the United States and abroad. With Judge Jeremy Fogel (now retired) and the Federal Judicial Center, she co-founded a novel intensive seminar focused on the human side of judging, now offered regularly to mid-career federal judges.

**Culture, Emotion, and Health: Dealing with Emotions in Sociocultural Contexts**

People generally want to increase positive emotions and decrease negative emotions. However, the extent to which individuals engage in such emotion regulation varies across cultures, partly due to differing beliefs about emotions. In this talk, I will present research highlighting cultural differences in dialectical versus predominantly adverse valuations of emotions. These variations in emotion valuations lead to cultural differences in emotion regulation and have health implications. I will also discuss sociocultural practices that support emotion beliefs and emotion regulation. By illuminating these processes, I will underscore the active role sociocultural contexts play in shaping emotions and their health implications.

The Emotion AI industry is at a very interesting junction. A small number of established start-ups exist and are looking to scale (Affectiva, BLUESKEYE AI, Hume), and the market is set to far exceed $50bn. At the same time, regulators and scientists are raising issues around privacy, evidence of effectiveness, and fairness, culminating in a partial ban of Emotion AI systems in the EU AI Act. In this salon, I will address the challenges and opportunities of creating a start-up in the area of Affective Computing.

**Convergence among Emotion Theories**

Although many scholars bemoan the lack of consensus among emotion theorists, current theories agree  on several important ideas, such as the adaptiveness of emotions and their principal components, and there is increasing convergence on divisive issues, such as discrete categories vs. continuous dimensions and the role of biology vs. culture. In the future our goal should be to distinguish real from apparent differences and to identify differences that can be resolved empirically.

**What Judges Feel: Investigating the Emotional Elements of Judging**

A cultural script of judicial dispassion long has positioned reason and emotion as natural opposites, law as the sanctuary of reason, and judges as the emotionless guardians of that boundary. Our present “age of affectism” exposes that script as both inaccurate and counterproductive. But what lies beyond it? In this talk, Professor Maroney will present an overview of her multi-year, mixed-methods empirical study into the role of emotion and its regulation in the lives and work of judges in the United States, giving us an early view of portions of her forthcoming book, What Judges Feel: How Emotions Shape Justice.
