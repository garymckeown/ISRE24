<!-- Our opening reception will be held on **the evening  of 17 July 2024 in the Great Hall in Parliament Buildings**. This iconic building, recognised the world over, is known locally as Stormont or the House on the Hill. It was opened in 1932 by the then Prince of Wales as the legislative centre of government in Nothern Ireland. It has watched over times of peace and times of tumult in the region. The beauty of its exterior is matched by its stunning interior, which houses furniture gifted by the British royal family and the Houses of Parliament.  -->

<!-- The Building is perfectly symmetrical, and when you take in your surroundings at our reception, you will be able to see its centre, marked by a chandelier gifted by Queen Elizabeth II. The Great Hall has hosted presidents, prime ministers and royalty, but there can surely be none as illustrious as our friends in ISRE. Do join us in this magnificent building, connect with your emotion colleagues, and immerse yourself in living history!! -->
