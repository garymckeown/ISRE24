Our opening reception will be held on the evening of 17 July 2024 in the Great Hall in Parliament Buildings. This iconic building, recognised the world over, is often referred to locally as the “House on the Hill”. Opened in 1932 by the then Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VIII, Parliament Buildings is the home of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The beauty of the Building’s exterior is matched by its equally stunning interior. 

The Great Hall, where our reception will take place, is made almost entirely from Italian Travertine, and the rich and vibrantly painted ceiling features five stunning chandeliers. The central chandelier was given to Parliament Buildings by Windsor Castle on long-term loan in 1932. This eminent venue has hosted presidents, prime ministers, popstars and royalty, but there can surely be none as illustrious as our friends in ISRE.  

Do join us on what is sure to be a conference to remember, connect with your emotion colleagues, and immerse yourself in the beauty, grandeur and history of Parliament Buildings.
