Belfast has a long ship-building heritage, including building of the world's most iconic ship the RMS Titanic in Belfast's Harland and Wolff shipyard. While we mourn the tragedy, in Belfast we also celebrate the engineering triumph and the industry that created it. In Belfast we joke: "It was fine when it left us."

The ISRE 2024 Banquet will take place in the Titanic Suite located on the top floors of Titanic Belfast with views of the Slipways and Belfast Lough, where the world famous liner was designed, built and launched. The decor in the Titanic Suites is themed on the interiors of Titanic and features a stunning replica of the linerâ€™s famous Grand Staircase.
